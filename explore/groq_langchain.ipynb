A clear violation of the Constitution, a clear usurpation of power prohibited, is required to justify pronouncing an act of the legislative department unconstitutional and void.\\n2. Courts should never declare a statute void unless the nullity and invalidity of the act are placed beyond a reasonable doubt.\\n3. A reasonable doubt must be solved in favor of the legislative action, and the act sustained.\\n4. Legislative power, except where the Constitution has imposed limits upon it, is practically absolute.\\n5. Limitations upon legislative power are to be strictly construed and are not to be given effect as against the general power of the Legislature unless such limitations clearly inhibit the act in question.\\n6. The court should hesitate long and be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt before pronouncing an act of Congress invalid. The argument should amount almost to a demonstration. If doubt exists, the act should be sustained, and the presumption is in favor of its validity.\\n\\nIn general, the burden will be upon the party attempting to demonstrate the invalidity of the law. The court will consider whether the law falls within the subject presented to the Legislature and whether it is valid on its face.'"
