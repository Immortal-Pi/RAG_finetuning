      "2. **Paying officers' costs without sufficient funds**: While it is competent for the County Judge to draw a warrant in favor of officers for costs due to them when sufficient funds are available, you should avoid doing so without ensuring that the amount of costs has been paid (ATTOHNEY GENERAL's OFFICE, AUSTIN, April 14, 1893).\n",

      "\n",
      "4. **Disregarding the authority of the Printing Board**: The Printing Board has the authority and duty to examine and audit claims against the State for printing department reports. You should not issue a warrant without the approval of the Board (ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, AUSTIN, June 22, 1893).\n",

      "5. **Failing to follow the correct procedure for filling vacancies**: In counties with a population of less than eight thousand inhabitants, the power to fill vacancies in the office of District and County Clerk is lodged in the Commissioners' Court. You should avoid appointing someone to this position without following the correct procedure (ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, AUSTIN, June 26, 1893).\n",
