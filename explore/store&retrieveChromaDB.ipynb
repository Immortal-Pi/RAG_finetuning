D. Varnell, Esq.. Counit Attorney, Clarksville. Texas.\\nDI)AR SmH-Replying to your favor of the l8th instant. in which you ask if\\nthe sureties on the recognizance of Tom Lowrance are liable, his appeal hav-\\ning been dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeals because no notice of appeal\\nappeared in the record. you are respectfully advised. that in the opinion of this-\\ndepartment the sureties are liable. The fact that appellant failed to give and\\nhave entered of record the required notice of appeal to confer jurisdiction on the\\nCourt of Criminal Appeals. will in no manner lessen the liability of him and his\\nsureties on his recognizance; he could not. thus. by his own laches and neglect.\\nrelieve himself of a valid judgment of your County Court. If the Court of Crimi-\\nnal Appeals\\'had acquired jurisdiction and afirmel the cas and he then failed\\nto appear in accordance with the conditions of his recognizance. then. under all\\nthe authorities, the sureties would be liable. In a case like this, when no affirm-\\nance is had. but the appeal is simply dismisse( with the order that the appellant\\npay the costs of appeal. there is no statutory direction as to the procedure in such\\na case, nor is there any decision by our appellate court which indicates the rule.\\nThen, in view of the silence of the statute and the absence of judicial construe-\\ntion, it can not be said that the question presented is altogether free from doubt:\\nit is not believed. however, that the mere silence of the statute in the precise\\nquestion indicated will leave the State without remedy when the defendant fails\\nto appear before the trial court -- from day to day and term to term an( not de-\\npart without leave of the court. in order to abide the judgment of tihe Court of\\nCriminal Appeals.- Where the defendant fails to appear, as in this case. his\\nrecognizance should he forfeited under article 440 et seq.. Code of Criminal Pro-\\ncedure. In case this is done the sureties will no doubt contend that under article\\n875. Code of Criminal Procedure. the right to forfeit a recognizance on appeal is\\nlimited to cases of allirmance of the judgment of the trial court, and that in all\\ncases other than an affirmance the bail bond is the obligation to proceed upon.\\nThis position seems to be supported by the case of Wells v. State. 21 Court of\\nAppeals. 594. We think, however, a dismissal under the circumstances stated is\\ntantamount to an affirmnance.\\nThe dismissal of the appeal is an afflirmation of the judgment below.\" State\\nv. Biesmuan (-Montana). 29 Pacific Reporter, 534. We therefore conclude that the\\ndoctrine announced in Wells v. State. supra. will not be held to extend to cases\\nwhere there is a judgnient of the Court of Appeals to be performed; the Wells\\ncase was reversed and no judgment of any kind was rendered against appellant.\\nThis case stands different: there is a juildgmnent of the Court of Appeals to be per-\\nformed, viz., payment of the cost of appeal. Then how shall that judgment be\\nperformed ? Evidently the law does not contemplate that it can be performed\\nin any other manner than that stipulated by the terms of his recognizance. i. e..\\nappearance before the trial court and payment of the judgment. .\"All bonds aid\\nrecognimizances for appearance to answer the charge of the State are intended to\\nsecure the trial of the offender rather than to mulet tile sureties.\" Jackson v.\\nState, 13 Texas, 218.\\nIn this case the offender has been tried and judgment rendered, but said ju(g-\\nment was suspended by entering into a recognizance. the conditions of which\\nevidently intend an ultimate performance of the judgment unless it is reversed\\nan( unless the principal literally complies with all the conditions of the recog-\\nnizance. both in manner and form as conditioned. the sureties are liable. and the\\nonly way to avoid liability is to bring the case within the exceptions enumerated\\nin article 452.

We advise you, however, to proceed\\nto forfeit the recognizance under articles 440, Code of Criminal Procedure. et\\nseq., and we are confident that the judgment rendered against the sureties can\\nbe made final and sustained.\\nIn answer to your second question, as to whether the arrest of the defendant.\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='523d1f04-37c9-4232-bdd4-0617c32213ea', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '6', 'file_name': 'texasLaw.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\pythonProjects\\\\RAG_finetuning\\\\explore\\\\..\\\\data\\\\texasLaw.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 5534498, 'creation_date': '2024-11-07', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-07'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 43:\\nafter his case had been dismissed by the Court of Appeals was legal, will say, it\\ndoes not appear that his recognizance had been forfeited, or that the sureties had\\nmade the affidavit required by article 500, Code of Criminal Procedure.

Texas.\\nDEAR Sm-Replying to your favor of the 10th instant. in which you state that\\nupon petition of five hundred citizens the registration law for cities over ten\\nthousand inhabitants was put in force for the last general election in the city of\\nFort Worth. and ask whether that is sufficient to make the law operative, in the\\ncoming municipal election, or whether another petition of live hundred citizens\\nis necessary. you are respectfully advised that in order to put said law in force\\nand make it govern in the coming municipal election it is necessary that a peti-\\ntion signed by five hundred citizens. asking for registration. be first presented\\nto your commissioners\\' court. The fact that such\\' petition was granted and the\\nlaw put in force for the last general election is not sufficient to continue the law\\nin force after such election.-- This conclusion follows from the language of the\\nact providing for registration. So much of said act as is necessary to a decision\\nof the questions presented by you reads as follows: \" There shall. upon the\\npetition of five hundred citizens of such city. be. prior to each general election.\\neither State. county, or municipal. had a registration of all voters in said city.\"\\nSection 1. p. 13. General Laws, first called session Twenty-second Legislature.\\nThis language clearly indicates that such petition is necessary -prior to each\\ngeneral election.\" If the Legislature intended that the law should continue in\\noperation after having been put in force. we apprehend that the above language\\nwould not appear in the act. Again, there is considerable expense incurred by\\nthe enforcement of the registration act. This expense is paid out of the general\\nfund of the county in State-and county elections, and out of the general fund of\\nthe city in city elections. Section 10. p. 14. General Laws first called session\\nTwenty-first Legislature. lt is not believed that a petition for registration in-a\\ngeneral State and county election will put the registration act in motion and\\nef\\'ect as to city elections. and thereby create a charge upon the revenue of the\\ncity for the expense of conducting registration in a municipal election; but it is\\nthe opinion of this department that when registration is desired in a municipal\\nelection, the proper petition therefor should be presented as required by section\\n1 above quoted. This it seems would be necessary in order to constitute a charge\\nupon the general funds of the city for the payment of the expense of conducting\\nregistration. It is the evident purpose of the registration act to permit cities of\\nten thousand inhabitants to invoke its provisions when desired. but not to force-\\nthem to accept same in all elections, whether State or municipal.

Travis Henderson, Chairman Finance Conmittee, House Representatives.\\nDEAR? Smt-Jn response to your verbal inquiry, 1 have made a careful investi-\\ngation of the question as to whether or not the Constitution, article 5. section 2,as amended September 22, 1891, fixes absolutely the salaries of the justices of the\\nSupreme Court of this State and the salaries of the judges of the Court of Crimi-\\nnal Appeals at four thousand dollars. Said section provides that the ChiefJustice and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court \" shall each receive an\\nannual salary of four thousand dollars, until otherwise provided by law.\" Sec-\\ntion 4 of said amended article provides that the judges of the Court of Criminal\\nAppeals shall have the same qualifications and receive the same salaries of the\\njudges of the Supreme Qourt. The question. tersely stated, would be. whether\\nthis provision of the Constitution is self-executing and fixes the salaries of these\\notlicers by its own terms, or whether legislation is necessary in order to fix the\\nsame. 7\\nThe Constitution of 1876, article 5. section 2, provided that the Chief Justice\\nand Associate Justices shall each receive an annual salary of not more than $3550.\\nThere was no statute regulating the salaries of these officers, and an annual ap-\\npropriation. in obedience to the terms of the Constitution. of 93550 has been\\nmade since its adoption for each of said officers. The amendment above quoted,\\nwhich was declared adopted September 22, superseded the Constitution of 1876,\\nand became. at the time of its adoption, the controlling law, and determined and\\nfixed the salaries of these officers at four thousand dollars per annum until other-\\nwise provided by the Legislature.\\nIn the case of Watson v. Aiken, 55 Texas, 536, a similar constitutional pro-\\nvision was held to be self-executing, regarding the legal rate of inte\\'rest. Sec-\\ntion 11, article XVI. of the Constitution provided substantially that all interest\\ncharged above 12 per cent shall be deemed usurious and the Legislature shall at\\nits first session provide appropriate pains and penalties to punish usury. In the\\nabove case it was held that any contract for a greater rate of interest than 12 per\\ncent was illegal, and that the interest could not be collected, notwithstanding\\nthat the Legislature had enacted no law providing appropriate pains and penal-\\nties. In the case submitted the amended Constitution is the only law now in\\nexistence which fixes the salaries of the justices of the Supreme Court. and it is\\nthe paramount law and needs no legislative action to give it force. The Legis-\\nlature has authority to change the salary provided for under the Constitution.\\nbut until such cbange has been made by the Legislature the salaries remain at\\nfour thousand dollars.\\n(Signed) 1cry respectfully.

The contention appears to be that articles 423 and 424 of the Revised\\nCivil Statutes require the Comptroller to register bonds which have been for-\\nwarded to him accompanied by a statement of the taxable values and tax levies.\\nwithout regard to the validity of the bonds or the legality of the tax levies.\\nArticle 42:3 provides: \\'\\' It shall be the duty of the mayor, whenever any bond\\nor bonds are issued, to forward the same to the Comptroller of Public Accounts\\nof the State. whose duty it shall be to register said bond or bonds in a book kept\\nfor that purpose. and to endorse on each bond so registered his certificate of\\nregistration. and to give at the request of the mayor his certificate certifying to\\nthe amount of bonds so registered in his office up to (late.\"\\nWithout. in this connection. considering article -124 at all. it is apparent that\\nthere devolves primarily upon the Comptroller the necessity of determining if\\nbonds had been issued by the city, If his duties be considered as entirely minis-\\nterial. there still devolves upon him the necessity of arriving at a conclusion as\\nto whether or not circumstances have arisen which would require the exercise of\\nhis official functions. It is certainly not every piece of lithographed paper that\\nmay be forwarded to the Comptroller that must be registered. The mere circum-\\nstance that the mayor and secretary of a city sign a piece of paper, upon which\\nis printed a recitation to the effect that the city will pay so much to bearer at a\\ndesignated time, does not create an obligation against the city, and does not\\nmake a bond issued by the city. A counterfeit presentment of a dollar is not a\\ndollar; a lithographed recitation of obligation, signed without authority, is not\\nan obligation: a putative bond issued without warrant of law is not a bond.\\nMore than the mere signature of officers is required; there must be authority to\\nsign. A bond is evidence of indebtedness. Upon the existence of the debt the\\nexistence of the bond is dependent.\\nIn the case of Bank v.

Until this is\\ndore the debt is not created and none exists.\"\\nThe action of the Comptroller is predicated upon the issue by a city of bonds;\\nthe bonds are dependent upon the creation of a debt; the debt is dependent upon\\ncompliance with the constitutional requirements regarding the levy of taxes. Ifit should appear to the Comptroller that no adequate tax levy has been made.\\nwould it also not appear that no duty devolved upon him with reference to what\\nmerely purported to be bonds of the city?\\nOne of the purposes which article 423 evidently intended to accomplish was to\\ngive notice to the world of the obligations outstanding of the city; it was to\\nbenefit alike the investing public and the debtor city. The former could examine\\nthis record in an investigation of a contemplated investment, the latter could\\nexhibit it as evidence that the authority of the city to issue bonds had not been\\nexceeded. The book of registration would serve much the same purpose with\\nregard to cities that the mortgage record of a county would with regard to an\\nindividual. If the construction contended for should be given, this salutary pur-\\npose of the law would be defeated, and instead of giving notice of the obligations\\nof the city, the certificate would. at least until it became understood that regis-\\ntration was merely nonsense prescribed by law, serve as an instrument to aid un-\\nscrupulous oflicials to defraud the innocent and unsuspecting.\\nBut registration was intended to more than merely give notice of the amount\\nof city bonds issued. The certificate placed upon the bond was expected to per-\\nform a still more important function. It was to be evidence that the bond upon\\nwhich it had been placed had been brought to the attention of an officer charged\\nthenceforth with the duty of seeing that the purchaser of the bond be paid the\\ninterest thereon as it fell due., and that provision be made for the payment of the\\nprincipal. Article 424 is to the effect, -that it shall be the duty of the mayor at\\nthe time of forwarding any of said bonds for registration, to furnish the Comp-\\ntroller with a statement of the value of all taxable property. real and personal,\\nin the city: also, with a statement of the amount of tax levied for the-\\'payment\\nof interest and to create a sinking fund. It is hereby made the duty of the Comp-\\ntroller to see that a tax is levied and collected by the city suflicient to pay the\\ninterest semi-annually on all bonds issued. and to create a sinking fund sufficient\\nto pay the said bonds at maturity, and that said sinking fund is invested in good\\ninterest-bearing securities.,\\nA duty is here imposed upon the Comptroller to be performed for the benefit\\nof the bondholders; the certificate is an earnest to the purchaser that the Comp-\\ntroller has assumed its discharge.\\nThe duty placed by the law upon the Comptroller. it would le impossible for\\nhim to perform if the bonds were not valid. 1le could not \"see that a tax is levied\\nand collected by the city sufficient to pay interest and create a sinking fund\"\\nif no debt was created by the city council in attempting to issue bonds. By\\nregistering bonds that were invalid, he would place it beyond his power to comply\\nwith the balance of the law. That construction certainly will not be given the\\nlaw which would require of the Comptroller that which is impossible. In order\\nto prevent the occurrence of such contingency provision is made by the law that\\nat the time bonds are forwarded for registration. the Comptroller be furnished\\nwith a statement of the value of all taxable property and of the taxes levied. This\\nis certainly the purpose for which these statements are required. If this be not\\ntrue, what other purpose was in contemplation ? No provision is made for their\\npreservation or record; no provision is made to the effect that the city should\\nbe estopped from denying the facts which they purport to recite. They are evi-\\ndently for the use of the Comptroller alone. It may be that the Comptroller is\\nnot the tribunal to finally adjudicate the legality of city bonds. Doubtless his\\ndecision is incapable of adding to their force or taking away from their effect.\\nBut certainly, so far as Ihis own duties are concerned, the question of validity he\\nmust incidentally pass upon. He must pass upon it just as the mayor should\\nconsider it when the paper is ready for his signature: just as the city secretary\\nshould examine it before he affixes the official seal of the city. It may doubtless\\nbe the case in many instances, even where the tax levy is apparently regular and\\nthe tax values justify the bond issue, that the bonds are invalid; possibly the law\\ndoes not contemplate that the Comptroller shall go behind these statements, but\\ncertainly he must apply to them the plain terms of the law.

John D. McCall, Comptroller, Austin.\\nDEAR Sim-We have your favor of the 15th instant, with its enclosures from\\nFirst National Bank of Abilene, Texas. relative to refunding certain taxes paid\\nto the State for the year 1891. It appears from the statements that the assessment\\nof the tax was properly made, and it is not shown but what the rolls were prop-\\nerly made out by the assessor and duly approved by the commissioners court as\\nrequired by law. In due time the taxes were paid. It seems that afterwards it\\nwas discovered by some one that the court only intended to assess the property\\nat three-fourths of its value. and at the regular term of the court in February,1893. an order was entered which purported to correct the assessment and reduce\\nit to three-fourths of its cash value, and ordered one-fourth of the county taxes\\nto be paild back to the bank.\\nThe question propounded by you is. whether. under the circumstances stated,\\nyou. as Comptroller of Public Accounts of this State, have the authority to re-\\nfund to the bank one-fourth of the State taxes so paid.\\nAmple rules are made for the protection of the citizens from excessive valua-\\ntion of property and the payment of excessive taxes thereon, but the remedy pro-\\nvided for in the statute must he pursued.\\nArticle 1517a, Sayles\\' Statutes. provides that the county commissioners courts\\nof the several counties of this State shall convene and sit as a board of equaliza-\\ntion on the second Monday in June. or as soon thereafter as practicable before\\nthe first day of July. to receive all tie assessment lists or books of the assessors\\nof their counties for their inspection. correction. equalization. and approval.\\nSection 2 of the same article provides that the board shall cause the assessor to\\nbring before them all the assessment books of the county for their inspection, to\\nsee that each and every person has rendered its property at its fair market value\\nas contemplated by law. Section 3 provides that the board of equalization shall\\nhave power to correct any errors in the assessment of property at any time before\\nthe tax is paid on said property.\\nWhen the taxes have been paid. it must be observed from tile reading of section\\n3 that the authority of the commissioners court sitting as a board of equalization\\nis exliausted. and they can not correct any errors in the assessment. If the tax\\nwas illegally assessed it would not be necessary to go before the hoard. as the\\ncollection could he enjoined in the courts.\\nCommissioners Court v. Conner. (5 Texas. 334.\\nIlardiste v.

This it failed\\nto do. The assessment was placed upon the rolls. subinitted to the board of equal-\\nization. the rolls approved, finally made out and accepted., and the taxes paid.\\nWhen this has been done the assessment-is no longer subject to revision or\\ncorrection by the court. and the action so taken by the court is final.\\nBuck v.

We,\\ntherefore, conejude that the two offices should not be united in one person. It is\\ntrue that in Gaal v.

The position of Librarian is\\ntherefore evidently not considered or treated by the Legislature as an office, as\\nthe clerk of the Supreme Court is ex officio librarian.\\nThere is, however, one other question to be considered. Article XVI, sec-\\ntion 33. of the Constitution, provides that the accounting officers of this State\\nshall neither draw nor pay a warrant upon the treasurer in favor of any person\\nfor salary or compensation as agent, officer or appointee who holds at the same\\ntime any other position of honor, trust or profit under this State or the United\\nStates, except as prescribed in this chapter. Under the provisions of the Con-stitution first cited it will be seen that it was entirely competent for the Legis-lature to provide such compensation as it saw fit for the services of the clerk of\\nthe Supreme Court, and it also had authority to impose upon the incumbent of\\nthat office such additional duties as to the Legislature seemed proper, not incon-\\nsistent with his duties as clerk of the Supreme Court. The duties of the libra-\\nrian of the Supreme Court are not believed to be inconsistent with the duties of\\nthe clerk of the Supreme Court. and there seems to be no good reason why the\\nduties of librarian may not be imposed upon and discharged by the clerk of the\\nSupreme Court. The general appropriation bills for the years 1893 and 1894 ap-\\npropriated, under the head of \"\\' Supreme Court,\" for clerk\\'s salary, $2500 each\\nyear, and under the same head, \\'\" Salary of librarian at Austin, $720 each year.\"\\nIt must be presumed that the Legislature made this appropriation with a\\nknowledge of the law which constitutes the clerk of the Supreme Court librarian\\nfor said court. and places in his charge the safe keeping of the Supreme Court\\nlibrary. and with knowledge that the Legislature has heretofore annually appro-\\npriated various sums for the librarian, while the clerk of the Supreme Court\\nheld that position and received the pay. The power being by the Constitution\\nvested in the Legislature to fix the compensation of the clerk at such sum as it\\nsaw fit, his compensation was by law fixed at $2500 per annum, and in addition\\nto this the Legislature appropriated for his services in the care and control of\\nthe library the sum of $720 per annum. These items should be construed\\ntogether, and both be given effect if possible. It is plain that no other person\\nthan the clerk of the Supreme Court can draw the salary appropriated for a\\nlibrarian, because that officer is expressly constituted librarian by the law above\\ncited, and the Legislature had knowledge of this when both these items were\\npassed. Construing the two together, it is believed that they should be given\\nthe same effect as if the Legislature had appropriated $2500 per annum for the\\nclerk of the Supreme Court for his services as such, and $720 per annum for the\\nclerk of the Supreme Court for his ex officio services and attention to the Supreme\\nCourt library, or as if the Legislature had enacted a law fixing the salary of the\\nclerk and then providing additional compensation for his attention to the library,\\nor as if it had appropriated in one item the, total sum for services as both libra-\\nrian and clerk.\\nThe conclusion follows from what is above said that you are authorized to\\ndraw your warrant in favor of the said C. S.

Comptroller, Austin.\\nDEAR Sim-We have a communication from your department requesting the\\nopinion of this department upon a question propounded to you by R. E. L. Tom-\\nlinson, county clerk of Falls county, of date May 31. The questions propounded\\nare: \" Whether or not a party who pays an occupation tax to the tax collector\\nmust file the tax collector\\'s receipt with the county clerk. and have the clerk\\nissue an occupation license to the person filing the receipt? If the clerk must\\nissue the license and if he is entitled to the fee therefor; if so, what fee?\"\\nIn support of the proposition that this course should be pursued. article 945\\nof the Revised Statutes is cited. That article provides. in substance, that upon\\npresentation of receipts for occupation taxes, the county clerk shall issue a\\nlicense to the person paying the tax, authorizing him to pursue the occupation\\nnamed in the receipt during the time for which he has paid the tax. Prior to\\nthe act of 1870, upon the subject of occupation taxes and the manner of keeping\\naccounts with collectors, the law regulating the keeping of such accounts was\\ndifferent from that prescribed in the act of 1879 (General Laws. p. 143.) For-\\nmerly it was necessary for the county clerk to have the receipt presented to him\\nand to issue a license thereupon, and by this means keep a check upon the tax\\ncollector as to the amount of occupation taxes paid to that officer. .\\nThe act of 1879, however, provided a different method for keeping accounts\\nwith tax collectors, relative to occupation taxes. Section 9 of said act, which\\nwas also inserted by the codifier in the Revised Statutes, provides, in substance,\\nthat the Comptroller shall cause occupation tax receipts for each occupation, to\\nbe printed with his signature for all occupations payable to collectors, and for-\\nward the same to each collector. and charge him with the amounts represented\\nby the receipts sent him, and cause him to account therefor. It also requires\\nthe collector to keep stubs and to report to the Comptroller. It further contains\\nthe following provision: \"And no person shall pursue any occupation unless he\\nhas a receipt signed as herein provided by the Comptroller and collector.\" This\\nclearly means that every person having such receipt may pursue the occupation.\\nIt is believed that the Legislature intended to provide and did provide a differ-\\nent system of keeping accounts upon tax collecters, and intended, among other\\nthings. by such amendment to relieve the tax-payer of the unnecessary burden\\nof contributing to the county clerk a fee for the issuance of a license based upon\\na receipt, when the receipt would answer all practical purposes, and the Comp-\\ntroller would have a check upon the collector for all receipts issued. It is not\\nbelieved therefore that the law requires any person to take out a license from\\nthe county clerk to pursue an occupation after he has paid his occupation tax\\nand received his receipt from the tax collector. This view is strengthened by afurther act of the Legislature subsequent to the act of 1879, which expressly re-\\nquires a person pursuing the occupation of a---iquor dealer to pay an occupation\\ntax and to apply to the clerk for a license for theatursuit of such occupation.\\nWhere the statute does not otherwise require -tbe issuance of a license by the-\\nclerk, it is not believed that the person pursding the occupation is required to.\\ntake the same out.\\nVery respectfully,\\n(Signed) FRANK ANDREWS.\\nOffice Assistant Attorney GeneraL\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='d1ab35ee-cc71-4fe7-a62b-eb48ecfcf35d', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '21', 'file_name': 'texasLaw.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\pythonProjects\\\\RAG_finetuning\\\\explore\\\\..\\\\data\\\\texasLaw.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 5534498, 'creation_date': '2024-11-07', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-07'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='58 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\nPrinting Board.- When the Printing Board has refused to audit an account for pub-\\nlic printing, the Comptroller has no authority to draw a warrant upon the Treas-\\nurer.for payment of the same.

Mere authority for such action\\nis there given. This authority has been exercised by the Legislature, however,\\nand it has expressly enacted that in such counties \" only one clerk shall be\\nelected.\"\\nRevised Statutes, articles 1, 115, 1159.\\nAlthough both the Constitution and the statutes employ the terms \" election\"\\nand \" elected \" only in this connection, yet it appears clear that the statute espe-\\n-cially evidences a legislative intention that only one person shall discharge the\\nduties of district and county clerk in such counties. That the Legislature so\\nintended when there is an election is manifest, and no reason is perceived for a\\ndifferent rule where an appointment is made. The ground for such action is not\\nthat there is an election rather than an appointment. but that there are less than\\neight thousand people in the county, and until the law unmistakably rests the\\ndistinction upon the narrower reason of election instead of appointment, it can\\nnot logically be adopted.\\nBeing of the opinion therefore that only one person can be appointed to the\\nvacancy, the more diflictilt question arises, By whom shall he be designated ? It\\nis believed the appointment is confided by the Constitution to the Coimnissioners\\nCourt of Rains county. It is well known that the duties of county clerk are\\nmore important and affect more intimately a larger number of citizens of the\\ncounty than those of the district clerk. and it is to be presumed that in consoli-dating these ollices the piurpose was to merge the least into the more important.\\nand to lodge the appointive power in officials of the localities most concerned\\nand interested. It will he noted, also. that the authority of the (listriet judges to\\nfill vacancies in the oflice of district clerk is for temporary purposes. and the\\nperson appointed shall hold only -- until the oflice can be tilled by election.\" It\\nis true the Legislature has not provided for a special election in the former case.\\nbut 1no one will doubt its authority to do so under this constitutional provision.\\nSo far as the Constitution bears on the question, the authority given the district\\njudge to appoint was not intended as a permanent induction into office, though\\nthe statute seeks to make it such. The power given the Commissioners Court,\\non the contrary, extends to filling the vacancy for the balance of the constjtu-\\ntional term of two years, and this difference should certainly have some weight\\nin determining the question which authority should be superseded in case of ap-\\nparent conflict.\\nRlegardless of these minor considerations, the conclusion reached is, in my\\njudgment. the proper construction of the Constitution. Sections 9 and 20 of\\narticle V should be construed together, and thus considered it is believed that in\\nall counties with a population of more than eight thousand persons the district\\njudge is authorized to fill vacancies in the office of district clerk; and in coun-\\nties with a population of less than eight t housand persons, when only one per-\\nson discharges the duties of district and county clerk, the power to fill vacancies\\nis lodged in the Commissioners Courts. It will certainly not be contended that\\nthe Constitution confides the authority jointly to the district judge and Commis-\\nsioners Court. Besides the want of definite language indicating such purpose,\\nits manifest incongruity places it beyond serious contemplation. Section 9.\\nwhich alone confers power in this particular upon district judges, is silent both\\nas to the consolidation of the offices and, the person authorized to fill vacancies\\nin such cases. Such .is not the case, however, with section 20. Providing for\\nthe election of county clerks, it also prescribes that vacancies in those offices\\nshall be filled by the Commissioners Courts, and in the same sentence authorizes\\na consolidation of the offices. The proviso in this section which authorizes \\'the.\\nconsolidation has.immediate reference to the paragraph that a county clerk shall\\nbe elected for each county, and defining his duties. Generally -peaking, the of-\\nfice of a proviso is to impose a limitation or condition upon a preceding clause.\\nand in this case, read in the light of the context, the condition is only upon the\\nduties to be performed. That is to say, there shall be elected for each county a\\ncounty clerk. who shall be clerk of the County and Commissioners Courts andrecorder of the county, subject to the right of the Legislature, in counties having\\na population Qf less than eight thousand. to cause a single clerk to be elected\\nwho shall perform the duties of district clerk.

This alone. regardless of the subsequent delays at Dallas and\\nAustin. was for -as long a period as three months.\\'\\nTo hold a case under advisement means to withhold a decision after submission\\nfor the purpose of consultation, for the convenience of the judges. because of\\ntheir negligence or for such other reasons as may cause delays, and thus con-\\nsidered it is believed this case was held under advisement within the meaning of\\nthis act.\\nJudge Brooks submits an allidavit to the efect. that the failure to render a de-\\neision at the Tyler Term was due to the -sickness, inability. or neglect\" of\\nJ.udge Terrell. If this be conceded. the conclusion reached is not affected, for\\nwe are of the opinion that. becituse of the delicacy and dificulty of inquiring\\nsatisfactorily into the causes which have induced special judges to postpone de-\\ncisions in causes. the Legislature. by this act, did not intend to devolve upon the\\nComptroller or other officers the duty of determining to what special judges the\\ndelay is attributable. Wherever a case has been submitted and a decision is post-\\nponled for three months for any of the reasons stated. whatever may have been\\nth action of individual special\\' judges., none of them are entitled to salaries out\\nof the deficiency appropriation.\\nVery respectfully,(Signed) Vyl MANN TRICE,\\nOffice Assistant Attorney General.\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='c1186479-4eb9-4519-9608-836e010d49f8', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '25', 'file_name': 'texasLaw.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\pythonProjects\\\\RAG_finetuning\\\\explore\\\\..\\\\data\\\\texasLaw.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 5534498, 'creation_date': '2024-11-07', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-07'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='62 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\nTimber Lands.- Cannot be sold to persons other than actual settlers.-More.than one-\\nsection of timbered land cannot be sold to one purchaser.\\nATTORNEY GENERAL\\'S OFFICE,\\nAUSTIN, June 27, 1893.\\nHon. IV. L. Mc Gaughey, Commissioner General Land Office, Austin.\\nDEAR SIR-I reply to your letter of the 21st instant with reference to the sale\\nof timbered land. A communication from Messrs. Mantooth & Townsend, of\\nLufkin, with whom you have. I presume from your letter, had correspondence,has also had consideration in the same connection.\\nThe questions presented may be succinctly stated:\\nMay lands classified as \" timbered\" be sold to persons other than actual set-\\ntlers?\\nMay more than one section of timbered land be sold to one purchaser?\\nSection 3 of the act of April 1, 1887, regarding the sale and lease of school and\\nother public lands (General Laws 1887, page 52). makes provision for the classi-\\nfication of lands belonging to.the funds mentioned, into \"agricultural, pasture,\\nand timber lands.\" Section 5. as amended in 1889 (General Laws 18,9. page 51),\\nprovides that when the classification has been made \" such land (that is the land\\nclassified) shall be subject to sale, but to actual settlers only \" in quantities be-\\ntween 80 and 640 acres. There is an exception to this limitation, to the effect\\nthat lands classified as \" purely pasture lands, and without permanent water\\nthereon,\" may be sold in quantities not exceeding four sections to the same set-\\ntler. It will be noted that the exception is not to land other than agricultural,but extends only to a portion of the lands classified as pasture lands. It will be\\nfurther noted that even the excepted lands must be sold to the actual settler.\\nThe proviso does not include -- timbered lands.\"\\nSection 7 fixes the prices of the several classes, placing lands \"valuable chiefly\\nfor the timber thereon \" at a minimum of five dollars.\\nSection 8. as amended in 1889, provides for sale to a former purchaser of an\\nagricultural or watered section of three ^ strictly pastoral\" sections. The pro-\\nvision is not extended to timbered lands.\\nSection 9 makes it the duty of the Commissioner to prescribe regulations\\nwhereby all purchasers shall be required to \" reside upon as a home the land pur-\\nchased by them for three consecutive years next succeeding the (late of their\\npurchase.\" This section also requires an affidavit that the purchaser desires the\\nland as a home and has settled thereon. It also prescribes the terms of pay-\\nmnent. and to the regulations then made there is a proviso to the effect that if\\nthe land applied for be -timbered land.\" the purchaser shall pay cash in full at\\nthe time of purchase.\\nSection 13, as amended in 1889. is with reference to timber and timbered land\\nexclusively. It gives the Commissioner authority to adopt such regulations re-\\ngarding the sale of timber on timbered land as may be deemed necessary; pre-\\nscribes minimum prices of timber per acre. and period within which purchaser\\nmust remove timber. In it there appears the following: \" and in no case * * *\\nshall less than one section of timbered land be sold to any one purchaser.\" The\\nsection is concluded with this proviso: \"All timbered lands from which the\\ntimber has been cut and taken off may be placed on the market and sold for\\nnot less than two dollars per acre, as other lands are sold under the provisions of\\nthis act.\"\\nAll sections of the act having a bearing upon the question submitted having\\nbeen reviewed, the law may be thus summarized: Lands having been classified\\nas agricultural, pasture. or timbered may be sold to actual settlers only in quan-\\ntities, of agricultural land of not less than 80 acres or more than 640 acres; of\\npasture lands, same with named exceptions: of timbered lands, not more nor less\\nthan one section.\\nThe conclusion reached therefore from a strict and literal construction of the\\nlaw, is that both interrogatories must be answered in the negative.\\nIt is suggested. however, that it was the intention of the Legislature to apply\\nthe provisions of the statute requiring settlement and continued occupancy, and\\nprescribing a limitation as to the amount thatmight be purchased, to agricultural\\nand pasture lands only.\\nIt may be that a different rule might with propriety have been prescribed with\\nreference to lands valuable chiefly for the timber and with regard to agricultural\\nlands.\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='bd9bf95d-861b-477a-b08f-6849bfbf1262', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '26', 'file_name': 'texasLaw.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\pythonProjects\\\\RAG_finetuning\\\\explore\\\\..\\\\data\\\\texasLaw.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 5534498, 'creation_date': '2024-11-07', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-07'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\nIt is doubtless also true that in most cases ownership of a single section of tim-\\nbered land will not justify the erection of saw-mills or the construction of ways.\\nof transportation of saw-logs. In fact, it may be that the terms of the law as\\nhere construed preclude the possibility, ordinarily, of sale of timbered land.\\nHowever this may be, the opinion is entertained that this is not a case in which\\nthe legislative intent may be looked to in order to fiestroy the plain terms of the\\nlegislative act. \" Courts are not at liberty to spequlate upon the intentions of\\nthe Legislature when the words are clear, and to coil strue an act upon their own\\nnotions of what ought to have been enacted. While it is the duty of one attempt-\\ning the interpretation of a statute to ascertain its intent, yet the statute itself\\nfurnished the best means of its own exposition.\"\\nThere are not in this law grammatical ambiguities., clauses or phrases that are\\nabsurd, provisions contradictory or inconsistent with the main proposition. I\\ndo not conceive it a case in which that which the Legislature has done maly be\\ndisregarded, in order that that which the Legislature might have intended to\\ndo may be so considered. I do not conceive it a case in which the certain im-\\nport of language may be ignored in order that a court, or an officer charged\\nwith interpretation, may enter the conjectural field of public policy.\\nIn an effort, however, to ascertain if possible that which the Legislature in-\\ntended should be done, the writer has examined carefully the journals of the\\nSenate and House of the Twentieth Legislature. by whom the law was passed,\\nand has attempted to become familiar with the circumstances attendant with the\\npassage of the bill and with the conditions that required its enactment.\\nIt appears that the original bill, or committee substitutetherefor, was a com-\\nplete and symmetrical measure. The general provisions of the bif were sub-\\njected to an exception with reference to timbered land, expressed lsection 13.\\nThis section placed the sale of timbered lands almost entirely within th~discre-\\ntion of the Commissioner. as it places now sale of timber within his diicretion.\\nAmendments were made that had the effect to entirely change the purport of the\\nsection. Except as to a single provision. which has been quoted, its provisions\\nwere made applicable to timber instead.of timbered land.\\nIf more than the language of the law is to be looked to in attempting to deter-\\nmine the legislative intent. it would not be improper to consider in that connec-\\ntion the history of this section. A proposition was made that the Commissioner\\nof the Land )fice be given authority to sell timbered lands, under such rules as\\nhe might prescribe. This proposition was repudiated, but authority was given\\nto sell timber at discretion.\\nThere can be no inference that the Legislature intended to do that which it\\nrefused to do. If the general terms of the bill are not applicable to timbered\\nlands, then there are no restrictions upon the authority of the Commissioner\\nwith reference to this character of land, except as to minimum price and mini-\\nmum amount that may be sold. Any number of sections might be sold to any\\nperson or corporation. Leaving out of cobsideration the refusal of the Legis-\\nlature to give such authority, there ought not to be inferred from silence a\\nlegislative intent to revive a land policy bitterly deplored and promptly repu-\\ndiated.\\nIf an intent is to be conjectured., it would be less difficult to suppose that the\\nLegislature favored the. policy of first selling the timber and then the lands.\\nEspecially could this be assumed as the policy of the Twenty-first Legislature,\\nwhich amended section 13 by adding the proviso to the effect \\'that all timbered\\nlands from which the timber has been cut may be sold as other lands under the\\nprovisions of this act.\"\\nDid the Legislature intend to enact that land valuable chiefly for timber might\\nbe sold in unlimited quantities to any person, while the same land, when its\\nchief value had. been taken away, might be sold to actual settlers only in quan-\\ntities not exceeding one section ?\\nIf the legislative intent be inquired into, the conclusion must be the same.\\nTimbered lands may be sold to actual settlers only, in quantities not exceeding\\none section.\\nNo opinion is expressed as to whether, under section 22, timbered land within\\nthe territory Prescribed by the law might, if detached and isolated, be sold to,\\npersons other than actual settlers.\\nVery respectfully,\\n(Signed) C.

John D MrcCall, Comptroller.\\nDEAR Si-Your letter of May 5, regarding the registration of bonds by the\\ncity of Laredo, was duly received. A determination of the question submitted\\nhas required an exhaustive examination of all the laws which have been passed\\nby the Legislature with reference to the incorporation of cities and towns, and a\\ncareful study of the constitutional prov- ions affecting taxation. This fact will\\nexplain delay in the reply.\\nYou ask, substantially. whether cities of more than ten thousand inhabitants.\\nincorporated under the general laws. may issue bonds in excess of an amount\\nthat a tax of twenty-five cents on the $100 valuation will pay interest on and\\ncreate a necessary fund suflicient for their redemption at maturity.\\n\\'The first general incorporation.law passed in this State was approved J\\' a ry27: 1858. (Chapter 1, General Laws 1858, page 69.) This law drew a stine-\\ntion between villages and towns. and towns and cities. Its first section p vided\\nfor the incorporation of a village of more than three hundred inhabitants into a\\ntown. Its 36th section provided for the incorporation of a village or town con-\\ntaining fifteen hundred inhabitants into a city.\\nThe only provision with reference to taxation was the 18th section, which pro-\\nvided that the board of aldermen should have power to levy taxes, not to exceed\\nfifty cents on the one hundred dollars. This law remained unamended until 1873,when by an act approved May 26, 1873 (chapter 65. General Laws 1873, page 98),section 1 was so changed as to provide that where a village or town may contain\\na population of two hundred souls,\\'it might be incorporated as a town in the\\nmanner prescribed by the act.\\nOn March 15. 1875, an act was passed 1* regulating the incorporation of cities\\nof one thousand inhabitants or over.\" etc. This act was evidently intended to\\ncover the entire subject of municipal corporations. containing 158 sections, and\\ncovering substantially every matter that could properly be the subject of munici-\\npal regulation.\\nIt provided, however, no terms upon which a city or town not incorporated\\ncould be incorporated. The first section was to the effect, \"that any city con-\\ntaining one thousand inhabitants or over may accept the provisions of this act.\"\\nThe 157th section was, that \" the provisions of this act shall not apply to any\\ncity within the limits of this State until its acceptance by the city council of such\\ncity in accordance with the provisions of section 1 of this act.\" It had been the\\nuniversal custom before 1858 for cities and towns to incorporate by special act of\\nthe Legislature. After the act of 1858, incorporation under the general law was\\npermitted, but it appears that prior to the adoption of our present Constitution\\nthis was rarely done. Cities incorporated under that law and cities incorporated\\nunder special charters were permitted to adopt the law of 1875.\\nSection 81 of the act of 1875 provides \" that the city council shall have power\\nto annually levy and collect taxes, not exceeding 1 per cent; provided, that by\\nconsent of two-thirds of the voters of said city, the city council may levy and\\ncollect an additional tax, not exceeding I per cent.\"\\nThe authority to issue bonds is regulated by section 70, to the following effect:\\nThe city council shall have power \"to appropriate so much of the revenues of\\nthe city, emanating from whatever source, for the purpose of retiring and dis-\\ncharging the accrued indebtedness of the city. and for the purpose of improving\\nthe public markets and streets, erecting and conducting city hospitals, city halls.\\nwaterworks, and so forth, as they may from time to time deem expedient; and\\nin furtherance of these objects they shall have power to borrow money upon the\\ncredit of the city and issue coupon bonds of the city therefor, in such sum or\\nsums as they may deem expedient. to bear interest not exceeding 10 per cent per\\nannum, payable semi-annually at such places as may be fixed by city ordinance;\\nprovided, that the aggregate amount of bonds issued by the city council shall at\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='44b7ad3a-aa7c-45f7-977c-bfeec57cd30a', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '28', 'file_name': 'texasLaw.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\pythonProjects\\\\RAG_finetuning\\\\explore\\\\..\\\\data\\\\texasLaw.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 5534498, 'creation_date': '2024-11-07', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-07'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 65\\nno time exceed 6 per cent of the value of the property within said city subject to\\nad valorem tax.\"\\nSection 78 provided that said bonds should be signed by the mayor and coun-\\ntersigned by the secretary, payable at such places and at such times as may be\\nfixed by ordinance of the city council, not less than ten nor more than fifty\\nyears.\\n\" The act of 1875 was in force when our present Constitution took effect, and\\nremained in force thereafter, except in so far as it was repugnant to the Consti-\\ntution.\"\\nGould v.

If a less sum than\\none-fourth of 1 per cent should have been sufficient to pay the current expenses.\\na tax of one-half of the State tax could have been levied, including the amount\\nlevied to defray current expenses.\\nGould v.

The power of cities of less than ten thousand inhabitants being specific-\\nally set forth, and this power being limited by section 9 of article VI l of the\\nConstitution to exclude all other power to tax, section 81 of the act of 1875, so\\nfar as it applied to cities and towns of less than ten thousand inhabitants, was\\nrepealed and the section of the Constitution above quoted took its place.\\nThere was no necessary conflict between section 5, article XI of the Constitu-\\ntion and section 81 of the law, section 5 fixing the maximum of taxation and\\nsection 81 continuing to provide for the levy of \" such taxes as may be author-\\nized by law.\"\\nThe power to issue bonds under section 76 was affected by the Constitution to\\nthis extent: First, no bonds could be issued without at the time of their issu-\\nA.

(2) For the erection of public buildings. Bonds for the last named pur-pose were limited to such an amount as a tax, not exceeding fifty cents on the\\none hundred dollars. would pay interest upon and create a sinking fund for ofat least 2 per cent. The bonds for indeotedness previously accrued were notlimited by any rate of taxation. Bonds for both these purposes must not aggre-\\ngate more than 6 per cent of the value of the property subject to tax. As none\\nof the purposes mentioned in section 76 could be the subject of bonded indebted-\\nness, except the two just mentioned, this rule would exclude bonds for the pur-\\npose of improving the public markets and streets, conducting city hospitals.erecting an(d conducting water works, and whatever improvements may have\\nbeen included under the very general expression -and so forth.\"\\nCities of ten thousand inhabitants continued, after the adoption of the Consti-\\ntutiion. to have the right to issue bonds for all purposes mentioned in section 76.\\nand no limitation was imposed upon this right except that at the time bonds were\\nissued provision must be made for their payment. an(d suclh provision could be\\nmfade under the Constitution and laws as they then existed to the extent men-\\ntioned in section 81.\\nEv the law of 1858. as amended in 1873. a distinctiou was made between towns\\nand villages containing two hundred inhabitants or more and towiis and cities\\ncontaining a population of fifteen hundred or more. The act of 1875 distin-\\nguished between towns an villages of two hundred anl less than one thousand\\ninhabitants anul cities with more than one thousand in habitants. By the (\\'on-\\nstitution of 1876, cities having more than ten thousand inhabitants were distin-\\nguished from cities and towns having a population of ten thousand inhabitants\\nor less.\\nIn Waxabachie v Brown. 67 Texas. 527. it is said. speaking of article Xl of\\ntile (Constitution : \"As to towns. there is no provision indicating any authority\\nto create a debt. nor any to issue bonds. except posSibly for the purpose of pay-\\ning any indebtedness which had accrued up to the time tile C onstitution went\\ninto etect.

However this may be. this case is authority for the\\nproposition that section 426 put into effect the constitutional provision author-\\nizing a tax of 2 ., per cent in cities of more than ten thousand inhabitants.\\nTo again define the authority of the cities of the different classes, the follow-\\ning authority as to taxation and indebtedness existed after the adoption of the\\nRevised Statutes of 1879: Cities and towns of more than one thousand inhabi-\\ntants. and not more than ten thousand inhabitants. had authority to levy and\\ncollect taxes, not exceeding one-fourth of one per cent. This was conferred by\\narticle 425. which is a copy of a portion of article 1. section 4. of the Constitu-\\ntion; it imphedly repealed all former authority to levy taxes and did not confer\\nupon city courfeils as much authority as would have been warranted under arti-\\ncle Vi1, section 9 of the Constitution. This article. as to cities of ten thousand\\ninhabitants or less. operated as a repeal of section 81 of the law of 1875.\\nArticle 420 of the Revised Statutes was a re-enactment of section 76 of the law\\nof 1875, but inasmuch as sections 5 and 7 of article XI of the Constitution re-\\nquired provision to be made for the payment of interest and the creation of a\\nsinking fund when bonds were issued, and inasmuch as it must be construed\\nthat article 425 was passed in response to the constitutional provision, which\\nprovided for a tax of one-fourth of one per cent for the current expenses of\\nthe city, and inasmuch as only some of the purposes mentioned in the article\\ncould be construed as current expenses, this article was practically ineffectual\\nso far as cities of less than ten thousand inhabitants were concerned; or at all\\nevents the limit of 6 per cent of the taxable values prescribed by article 420 was\\nfurther reduced by article 425, which defined, and by defining. limited the\\npower of taxation. Unless it be held that article IX. section 8. of the Constitu-\\ntion. taken together with article XI, section 6. of the Constitution. were self-\\nexecuting, no provision was made even for the issuance of bonds to pay indebt-\\nness that had accrued prior to the adoption of the Constitution. because at no\\nother place is authority to levy a tax for this purpose given.\\nCities of more than ten thousand inhabitants had, after the adoption of the\\nRevised Statutes. authority, according to Muller v. City of Denison. supra. to\\nlevy and collect tle maximum tax of 22 per cent permitted by the Constitution,\\nand they had authority to issue bonds, not exceeding in amount 0 per cent of the\\ntaxable values of the city. for the purpose of retiring and lischarging the ac-\\ncrued indebtedness of the city, for the purpose of improving the public mar-\\nkets and streets. erecting and conducting city hospitals. city halls, water-works,\\nand so forth.\\nThe question that now arises is whether this authority has been abridged.\\nSection 9, article VIII, of the Constitution, was amended by a joint resolu-\\ntion, submitted April 7. 1883, and after amendment read as follows: \"The State\\ntax on property. exclusive of the tax neccessary to pay the public debt and of\\nthe taxes provided for the benefit of the public free schools, shall never exceed\\nthirty-five cents on the one hundred dollars valuation. except for the payment\\nof debts incurred prior to the adoption of this amendment, and for the erection\\nof public buildings, streets, sewers, and other permanent improvements.\"\\nOn March 31. 1885, an act was passed \" to authorize cities and towns to levy\\nand collect a tax for the erection. construction or purchase of public buildings,\\nstreets, sewers. and other permanent improvements.\" In this it is provided that\\nany city or town council, or board of aldermen of any incorporated city or town\\nwithin the limits of this State shall have power. by ordinance, to levy and collect\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='9ad6d319-760b-4ca1-81cd-006cf6479dd7', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '31', 'file_name': 'texasLaw.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\pythonProjects\\\\RAG_finetuning\\\\explore\\\\..\\\\data\\\\texasLaw.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 5534498, 'creation_date': '2024-11-07', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-07'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='68 REPORT -OF ATTORNEY GEINERAL.\\nan annual ad valorem tax of not exceeding twenty-five cents on the one hundred\\ndollars valuation of the taxable property within such city or town, for the erec-\\ntion. construction or purchase of public buildings, streets. sewers. and other\\npermanent improvements. within the limits of such city or town.. [General\\nLaws 1885, chapter 107. page 99.]\\nThis act was intended to affect cities of ten thousand inhabitants or less only.\\nThis conclusion is reached from the circumstance that it purports to be an affirm-\\native grant of power. from the circumstance that it has no repealing clause. that\\ncities of more than ten thousand inhabitants had, prior to this time, the rights\\nwhich are here conferred. This conclusion is further reinforced by the recita-\\ntions in section 2 of the act. to the following effect: \" Whereas, many cities\\nand towns of this State are without the necessary funds to defray the expense\\nof erecting public buildings and other needed permanent improvements for the\\nreason that no law has been enacted to conform the tax law of such cities and\\ntown to the amended Constitution, etc.\" The law was evidently passed in con-\\nformity with the constitutional amendment of 1883. This amendment did not\\naffect the taxing power of cities of more than ten thousand inhabitants. Cities\\nof this class, incorporated un der the generaL laws were not \" without the neces-\\nsary funds to defray the expense of erecting public buildings and other needed\\npermanent improvements for the reason that they were not authorized to levy\\nthe requisite tax;\" on the contrary. they had the authority to levy the requisite-\\ntax. After the passage of this law. cities of more than ten thousand inhabitants\\ncontinued with authority to levy a tax of 21 per cent and to issue bonds to the\\namount of 0 per cent of the taxable values.\\nThe case of Muller v. Citv of Denison is authority for the proposition that the\\nact of Marcli 23. 1887, which will hereafter be discussed, does not operate as a\\nrepeal of article 426. If this be true, then there can be no doubt of the correct-\\nness of the proposition just made.\\nWe are brought to the act of March 23. 1887. and to the construction of its\\neffect upon the authority of cities to levy taxes and issue bonds. This was en-\\ntitled \"An act to authorize cities and towns to levy and collect taxes for the con-\\nstruction or purchase of public.buildings. water works. sewers, improvements of\\nstreets. and other permanent improvements, and to issue bonds therefor, and to\\nrepeal all laws in conflict herewith.\" It provides for the levy and collection of\\na tax sufficient to meet the interest and sinking fund on all indebtedness incurred\\nprior to the adoption of the constitutional amendment of 1883; for the levy and\\ncollection of a tax of twenty-five cents for current expenses: for the levy and col-\\nlection of an additional tax of twenty-five cents for the construction or the pur-\\nchase of public buildings. water works. sewers. streets, or other permanent im-\\nprovements within the limits of such city or town; and it provides that for such\\nimprovements such city shall have the power to issue coupon bonds of the city\\ntherefor, but it is provided that the -aggregate amount of bonds issued for the\\npurpose named shall never reach an amount where the tax of one-fourth of one\\nper cent will not pay current interest and provide a sinking fund sufficient to pay\\nthe principal at maturity, and the amount of bonds legally issued under acts\\npassed prior to the adoption of the present Constitution shall not be computed in\\nestimating the amount of bonds which may be issued for the above named city\\nimprovements.\" Section 2 repeals all laws in conflict with the get. Section 3\\n(the emergency clause) recites that there is some doubt as to the existing power\\nof cities and towns to levy and collect taxes for the purpose of improving such\\ncities and towns. and further. that there are many cities and towns without\\nthe necessary means to make the needed permanent improvements. and that it isimportant that definite power should be given to conform the tax law of such\\ncities and towns to the amended Constitution.\\nIt is apparent that this act su\\'persedes the act of 1885, heretofore mentioned,\\nwhich had superseded article 425 of the Revised Statutes, and. as stated, the case\\nof Muller v. City of Denison is authority for the proposition that article 426 was\\nnot amended by the act under consideration.\\nIt is suggested in this opinion, that the \" scheme of municipal taxation, as de-\\nvised by the framers of our Constitution,\\'proceeds upon different plans accord-\\ning as it refers to cities and towns with a population of less than ten thousand\\ninhabitants. and to cities with a population of more than ten thousand inhabi-\\ntants,\" and this is shown by the argument of the court.\\nThe question that now arises is whether the provisions placed in this law. per-\\nmitting a tax of twenty-five cents, which the Constitution authorizes in cities of\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='acbe050e-9bbd-4a61-919d-5521e7b45929', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '32', 'file_name': 'texasLaw.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\pythonProjects\\\\RAG_finetuning\\\\explore\\\\..\\\\data\\\\texasLaw.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 5534498, 'creation_date': '2024-11-07', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-07'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 69\\nten thousand inhabitants or less., for public improvements, to be\\' taken as the\\nbasis for a bond issue, operates as a limitation or repeal of the law which per-mitted cities of more than ten thousand inhabitants to issue bonds to an amount\\nnot exceeding 6 per cent of its taxable value. Section 2 of the law repeals all\\nlaws in conflict with this act. This would perhaps result without such a repeal-ing clause. One law without a repealing clause supersedes a prior one to the.extent of a conflict. The question then arises as to whether or not a conflict ex-ists. Under the decisions cited. this permit of an additional tax does not in anymanner conflict with the tax which cities of ten thousand inhabitants or more\\nwere already permitted to levy. Why, then, should it be held that this bondissue. based upon this tax, dependent upon it. comes in conflict with the author-ity given cities of. more than ten thousand inhabitants to issue bonds dependent\\nand based upon an entirely different and independent levy? How, indeed,\\nleaving these views out of consideration, can it be said that the giving here of\\nthis authority to issue bonds providing for the improvements here mentioned,\\ncomes in conflict with authority previously given to issue bonds for some of the\\npurposes here named and for other purposes ? Could it not be as easily held a\\n.cumulative right. a cumulative authority ? Glancing over the laws which have\\nbeen mentioned, it will appear that from the adoption of the present Constitu-\\ntion up to the present time. every legislative act has been an extension of the\\nauthority of cities and towns with reference to taxation and the right to incur\\nindebtedness. A review of the same laws indicates that every extension has\\nbeen directed to cities and towns of less than ten thousand inhabitants, and that\\nup to the law of 1889, which will hereafter be reviewed. no amendment affecting\\ncities of more than ten thousand inhabitants was made to the law, unless by in-\\nference or implication.\\nArticle 426. as originally adopted, gave authority to levy a tax of twenty-five\\ncents on the oie hundred dollars in cities and towns of less than ten thousand in-\\nhabitants. When the Constitution was amended in 1883. this authority to tax\\nwas extended to conform to its provisions. This authority was again extended\\nin 1887, and there was attached to the power of taxation thus extended the right\\nto issue bonds. Article 426 and the constitutional provision upon which it was\\nbased, article V, section I1 of the Constitution, were independent primarily of\\nsection 8, article IX. of the Constitution, and the changes to that article fnd the\\nlegislation which has resulted from such changes have not affected them. Why\\nshould it be assumed that legislation evidently intended to enlarge the powers of\\none class of cities resulted by implication in the abridgement of the authority of\\nthe cities of another class? The plain intimation of the court in Muller v. City\\nof Denison, and the case of Texas Water and Gas Company v. Cleburne (21\\nSouthwestern Reporter, 391. 393). is to the effect that the legislation mentioned\\nhas affected cities of ten thousand inhabitants or less only. and has in no degree\\nabridged the powers or lessened the duties of cities of more than ten thousand\\ninhabitants.\\nAt no point in the history of legislation is article 420 of the Revised Statutes\\nin terms repealed.

Is the county legally liable for any part of the expenses incurred by\\nthe city, and can the same be collected from the county by law?\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available .\\n\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='8d58bb60-ab1d-4346-b5e7-a574c028f8ea', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '34', 'file_name': 'texasLaw.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\pythonProjects\\\\RAG_finetuning\\\\explore\\\\..\\\\data\\\\texasLaw.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 5534498, 'creation_date': '2024-11-07', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-07'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text=\"REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 71\\nSecond.

Whether or not the action of the Commissioners Court in refusing to\\npay the claim was in the nature of a final judgment which settles the question or\\nmay it be opened and again repeatedly passed upon by the court from time to\\ntime?\\nIt seems that the first proposition must be answered in the negative. The city\\nauthorities had no power to contract a debt against the county without the con-\\nsent and authority of its Commissioners Court duly passed in an open session of\\nthat body.

It is not believed that the action of said court was in\\nthe nature of a final judgment which renders the matter re- adjzidicata. but\\nrather that the action was of the same nature that would have been in the re-\\nfusal to pay any other claim against the county, or in refusing to do any other\\nact which it was competent for tbat court to do. While the auditing or refusal\\nto audit a claim may be considered quasi judicial, yet it is not believed that the\\nrefusal is a final judgment. as that term is judicially understood, and it would\\nb6 competent for the Commissioners Court to again consider the question at any\\nsubsequent term.\\nIn reply to your last question. as to whether this claim could be passed and\\nallowed by three commissioners, two of whom favor it, you are referred to\\narticle 1510.

It is believed, therefore. that\\nas the Commissioners' Court would have had the authority to have made such an\\nexpenditure as was made by the city, that said court would have the authority\\nto assume an expenditure made by the city for this purpose, if in the exercise of\\na sound discretion it saw proper so to do, and this notwithstanding the court\\nmay have formerly refused to allow any part of the claim.\\n(Signed) Very respectfully, FRANK ANDREWS,\\nOffice Assistant Attorney General.\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available\\n\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='9f023e03-dc86-4a0c-adac-2ebc51150ce1', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '35', 'file_name': 'texasLaw.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\pythonProjects\\\\RAG_finetuning\\\\explore\\\\..\\\\data\\\\texasLaw.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 5534498, 'creation_date': '2024-11-07', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-07'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='72 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\nResidence on School Land.-A purchaser of school land under the act of 1887; tWho\\nprior to the expiration of the three years\\' occupancy required. has been elected\\n(rountU clerk of his county, and removes temporarily from his section, intending to\\nreturn to it upon the conclusion o~f his term of otflce, in the meantime improving it\\nand claiming it as his permanent home, has complied with all the requirements of\\nlaw and is entitled to a patent.\\nATTORNEY GENERAL\\'S OFFICE,\\nAUSTIN, June 30, 1893.\\nlon.

You request an\\nopinion as to whether, other requirements of the law having been compiled with,\\nhe is entitled to patent.\\nSection 5 of the act of 1887 provides for sale \" to actual settlers only.\" Section\\n9 makes it the duty of the Commissioner to prescribe regulations whereby pur-\\nchasers shall be required \" to reside upon as a home \" the land. The section also\\nmakes \" proof of such residence and occupancy \" necessary. It also prescribes\\nan aflidavit to the effect that applicant \" desires to purchase the land for ahome.\"\\nAt the time of the sale the purchaser was -an actual settler.\" To the date of his\\nelection as county clerk he \" occupied \" the land and \" resided upon \" it \" as a\\nhome.\"\\nIt is provided by statute that certain county officers shall keep their offices at\\nthe county seat. When the purchaser of State lands was elected to the county\\nclerkship. it became necessary for him., under the statute, to remove to the county\\nseat and there remain during his incumbency.\\nDid he by responding to the wishes of his fellows. the terms of the statute.\\nand the requirements of his official position, abandon his \" occupancy \" and his\\n\" residence upon the land as his home,\" though he still regarded the land as his\\nhome, continued to improve, and intended to return to it upon the termination\\nof his offlicial career?\\nThe word \"occupancy\" as used in the statute cannot have a broader meaning\\nthan \" actual possession,\" and the facts considered do not preclude the only pos-\\nsession that may be had of real estate. In Foreman v. Meroney. 62 Texas, 727. it\\nwas said that the words -- use or occupancy as a homestead \" did not require a\\nperson to \" actually remain upon- the land.\" The phraseology of the clause\\n\"residence upon the land as a home\" naturally suggests analogy to our home-\\nstead laws.\\nSo far as these laws are concerned, there is no question that under the facts\\nstated abandonment of the homestead has not resulted, and that as against cred-\\nitors of the purchaser the land claim, notwithstanding his temporary removal,would be exempt from execution.\\nBy the word \" residence\\' is usually meant the place of permanent abode, as\\ndistinguished from the place where caprice of pleasure or the demands of busi-\\nness may require a temporary abode. When it is used in connection with the\\nphrase \" as a home\" it becomes clear that this was the significance intended to\\nhere attach.\\nIt was said in Foreman v. Meroney. supra The homestead is not to be\\nlikened to prison bounds, within which the family must always remain, but to a\\nsanctuary to which they may always return.\" If a distinction may be made\\nbetween \"homestead\" and \"home.\" it must be held that the former is more\\ntechnical and limited. Character as a home will not be taken away from a place\\nbecause its former owner may find it necessary in the struggle for existence to\\ntemporarily reside elsewhere.

Texas.\\nDEAR SIR-The complaintof the citizens df Houston. submitted by vou, that\\nthe Houston and Texas Central Railroad Comphny has violated the laws of the\\nState in removing its land department from that city to the city of San Antonio.\\nhas been carefully considered. The material facts appear to be that this cum-\\npany is practically the successor of the Houston and Texas Central Railway\\nCompany. and now operates the road formerly owned by the latter company:\\nthat by its charter its principal office is fixed at the city of Houston, and that\\nrecently what is termed the -- land department\" of the company. consisting of\\nits land commissioner and clerks, and all books. documents, and records per-\\ntaining thereto, have been removed to San Antonio. and all the business of that\\ndepartment is now being transacted there. Since the complaint was made it is\\nunderstood the books. documents. and records which pertain to their right of\\nway. town lots, and depot and switching facilities, the use of which enters into\\nthe operation of the road. have been returned to Houston and placed in charge\\nof a competent official. leaving at San Antonio only such records as affect\\nthe lands claimed to have been granted the original company by the State. It\\nis insisted by the Land Commissioner that the present company is not the owner\\nand does not control any of the lands donated by the State, and consequently has\\nno \"land department \" in charge of such lands, but that the lands are owned\\nand controlled by a private individual. For several reasons the contention can-\\nnot be sustained, but in the view taken of the case it is unnecessary to enter\\ninto a discussion of this matter. Assuming that these lands are owned and con-\\ntrolled by the company now operating the road, the question presented is-\\nwhether our laws require railway companies to keep and maintain their land de-\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='4f37e993-0ef4-496d-b954-1e0d5dfafb43', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '39', 'file_name': 'texasLaw.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\pythonProjects\\\\RAG_finetuning\\\\explore\\\\..\\\\data\\\\texasLaw.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 5534498, 'creation_date': '2024-11-07', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-07'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='76 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\npartinent, to which are given the sale, lease and general custody of lands do-\\nnated by the State, and not used or available in the operation of their roads, at\\n.the place where the general offices are located.\\nThe Constitution (article X. section 3) requires railway companies to keep a\\npublic office In this State. The first Legislature which convened after the\\n-adoption of the Constitution required them to maintain a public office on the\\nline of their road in this State (Laws 1876, page 144), and this requirement was\\nretained (Revised Statutes. article 4115) in the Revision of 1879. There was no\\n-other legislation on this subject until the passage of the act of March 28, 1885\\n(General Laws 1885, p. 67), in which it was provided that railway companies\\nshould have and maintain a public office in the locality where their principal\\nbusiness is carried on in this State. on the line of their roads, for the transaction\\nof their business, \" where transfers of stock shall be made, where the auditor,treasurer. general traffic manager, and general superintendent of such roads, or\\nwhere an agent of such corporation, duly authorized tp adjust and settle all\\nclaims against such corporation for damages, shall have their respective offices,\\nand where shall be kept for the inspection of the stockholders.\" and such officers\\nor agents of the State as may be authorized to inspect them, the books of the\\ncompanies showing the capital stock. ownership thereof, amount paid, transfers\\nof stock. amounts of assets and liabilities and the names and places of residence\\nof their officers.\\nThe only other legislation applicable to the subject is the act approved March\\n27. 1889. By the first section of this act it is provided, among other things, that\\nevery railroad company chartered by this State or owning or operating any line\\nof railway within this Sttite shall keep and maintain permanently its general\\noilices within this State at the place named in its charter for the location of its\\n.general otlices. So much of section 2 as is pertinent to this inquiry is as follows:\\n** It shall be the duty of said railroad company to keep and maintain at the place\\nwithin this State where its general offices are located, the office of the president\\nor vice president. also the oflices of its secretary, treasurer, local treasurer,\\nauditor, gineral freight agent. traffic manager, general manager, general super-\\nintendent, general passenger and ticket agent. chief engineer, superintendent of\\nmotive power and machinery, master mechanic. master of transportation, train\\nmaster, stock and fuel agent, claim agent, and each and every one of its general\\noffices shall be kept and maintained; by whatever name it is known, and the per-\\nsons who perform the duties of said general offices. by whatever name known,\\nshall keep and maintain their offices at the place where the general offices of said\\nrailroad are required by law to be kept and maintained; and if the duties of any\\nof the above named offices are performed by any person. but his position is called\\nby a different name. it is hereby made the duty of said railroad company to have\\nand maintain said oflices at the place where its general Texas offices are kept and\\nmaintained as required by this act, * * * the object and meaning of this stat-\\nute being to require every railroad company owning or operating a line of rail-\\nway within this State, to keep and maintain its general offices within this State at\\nsuch places as required herein, and the name of the above as general offices shall\\nnot be understood to allow the railroad company to have any of the offices usually\\nknown as general oflices at any other place than the one it is required to keep its\\ngeneral offices at, and each and every railroad is hereby required to have and\\nmaintain its general oflices at the place named herein.\"\\nFrom this statement it is apparent that if the land department of this company\\nis one of its general offices within the meaning of these statutes, it must be kept\\nand maintained permanently at Houston. This is the sole question to be deter-\\nmined. If the act of 1885, in its application to this subject, may not be con-\\nsidered as superseded by the act of 1889. it is manifest that the land department\\nis not included in the offices there named, for the commissioner is neither\\nauditor, treasurer, general traffic manager, nor general superintendent, nor does\\nlie perform any of the duties usually discharged by such officers, nor is he an\\nagent of the company authorized to settle and adjust claims against it for dam-\\nages, nor the custodian of the books required to be kept by the act. It is equally\\nplain that it is not included in the act of 1889 eo nomine, and whether it is em-\\nbraced in certain general provisions of the act is the difficult question presented.\\nThe first section of the act requires, without naming them, that the \" general\\noffices\" of the company shall be kept and maintained at the place where its \"gen-\\neral offices are located. the office of the president or vice president,\\' etc., and by\\nthis the Legislature seems to have intended to enumerate the general officers who\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='4f86fee8-6353-4fe7-9826-88029a600cdd', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '40', 'file_name': 'texasLaw.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\pythonProjects\\\\RAG_finetuning\\\\explore\\\\..\\\\data\\\\texasLaw.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 5534498, 'creation_date': '2024-11-07', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-07'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 77\\nshall reside and keep their offices at that place, adding the general clause that\\n\" each and every one of its general offices shall be so kept and maintained. by\\nwhatever name it is known. and the persons who perform the duties of said gen-\\neral offices, by whatever name known, shall keep and maintain their offices at the-\\nplace where said general offices are required to be located and maintained, and\\nthe persons holding said general offices of a railroad shall reside at the place and\\nkeep and maintain their offices at the place where the general offices of said rail-\\nroad are required by law to be kept and maintained; and if the duties of any of\\nthe above named offices are performed by any person, but his position is called\\nbya different name. it is hereby made the duty of said railroad company to have\\nand maintain said offices at the place where its general Texas offices are kept and\\nmaintained as required by this act.\" an(d that \\' the name of the above as general\\noffices shall not be understood to allow the railroad company to have any of the\\noffices usually -known as general offices at any other place.\" The first of these\\ngeneral provisions refers in terms to the preceding enumeration of officers. and\\nconsequently is not more comprehensive; and. regarding the purpose of the act,\\nthe use of the words \" usually known as general offices\" in the second section\\nwas not intended to do more than supply the possible omission of offices con-\\nnected with the operation of the road as a railway and of a kindred nature to\\nthose previously named. The purpose of the act is to deal only with officers of\\nthe company whose duties pertain to its business as a common carrier of freight\\nand passengers.\\nThis construction accords with the history and policy of this legislation.\\nPrior to the act of 1885 many of the railways of the State were controlled by an\\nillegal combination, ind such of their general offices as are named in said act\\nwere kept and maintined in other States. All business in charge of the general\\nsuperintendents, general managers. treasurers. auditors. freight and passenger\\nagents. and claim agents were transacted there. All complaints of passengers\\nand shippers were required to wait upon the tedious and unsatisfactory process\\nof adjustment under such a system. Unquestionably the Constitution required\\nthe maintenance of a public oflice in the State. but legislation was necessary to\\nenumerate the several offices and provide adequate penalties. and consequently\\nthis act was passed. The policy of this and subsequent legislation rests largely\\nin the convenience of the people. and is indicative of its-purpose. The officials\\nof the companies charged with their management, brought together on their\\nlines. can more rapidly and satisfactorily discharg? their duties: obviously more\\npeople living on the line of roads have business with the companies as common\\ncarriers than elsewhere. and public interests are subserved by the concentration\\nand maintaining of such offices on the line of road. These considerations, how-\\never, do not affect the land department. for it can neither be said that the com-\\nmissioner can conduct the business more advantageously at some point on the\\nroad. nor that purchasers and lessees will be more numerous along the line of\\nrailway.\\nThe history of the act of 1889 is particularly significant of its bearing upon\\nthis question. The Texas and Pacific Railway Company contracted to locate and\\nmaintain permanently its general offices. roundhouses and machine shops at\\nMarshall, and did locate them there. About 1884 the land department of\\nthat company, which had been maintained at Marshall, was removed to Dallas:\\nand afterwards the company removed its general otlices to Dallas. It is well\\nknown that the law of 1889. the authors of which represented Marshall in the\\nIhegislature. was intended to have particular application to that case. yet while\\nit was understood that the land department had been removed, and while the\\nrepresentatives of that city exercised the precaution to enumerate all general\\noflices connected with the operation of the road whose designation was known.\\nand by general provision to guard against changes of destination and every\\ncharacter of evasion, this department was not named. In view of these facts and\\nthe apparent ambiguity of the law, this ommission must be given controlling\\nweight.\\nContrary to my first impression. I am of the opinion that the land department\\nof this company, as now conducted at San Antonio, is not one of the general\\noffices within the meaning of the statutes.\\nVery truly yours, -\\n(Signed) C.A.

It is believed that this provision precludes an elec-\\ntion for any subdivision of the territory for which the former-election was held.\\nunless it comes within the exemptions of article 3238. and that the law does not\\nintend to say that no election for the identical limits prescribed in the first ap-\\nplication. shall be held. but that no election shall be held within a part of the\\nterritory which was within the limits prescribed for the territory in which the\\nelection was formerly held: that is to say, if the election be for an entire county,\\nno subdivision within such cou nty could legally vote upon the proposition again\\nfor two years.

G, 7. and S of the act -of July 8. 1879, and does not amend the sections\\nof said last act relative to forfeiture and transfer of the lands.\\nSection 15 of the act of 1879 provides that if any purchaser desires to sell said\\nland after he has made his first payment on the same, be may do so; but in that\\nevent his vendee shall file in the General Land Officeta properly authenticated\\ntransfer from said purchaser. and said vendee shall be liable to the obligations\\nand penalties imposed upon said original purchaser. It may be that the declara-\\ntion in this section that the vendee shall be liable to the obligations and penal-\\nties imposed upon said original purchaser is tantamount to a declaration that\\nwhen the obligations and liabilities are so assumed bv the subsequent vendee.\\nthe original purchaser shall be released from all further liability. If the original\\npurchaser had sold the land and the transfer. properly authenticated. was filed\\nin the General Land YOflice. and lie thereby became released from further lia-\\nbility. and parted with his interest in the land. he would neither be a necessary\\nnor a proper party to the suit. B ut. however this may be. the subsequent ven-\\ndee of the original purchaser who held the transfer from the original purchaser\\nwould not only be a proper but a necessary party to the suit to obtain a valid\\nj*ugment for the property sued for. and without such vendee being made a party\\nto the suit, his interest would not be concluded, because the lien of the State on\\nthe land is not expressly reserved. but arises by implication only. Foster v.\\nPowers. 64 Texas. 247. If it be said that the doctrine of purchase money liens\\nis not applicable to the question. and it lie conceded for the sake of argument.\\nthe same result follows. for in that case the title passes to the subsequent vendee\\nby force of the statute and transfer. and before it can be divested he must be\\nmade a party to the suit.\\nThe general rule. as stated in Black on Judgnments. section 600. is: \"It is a\\nuniversal rule that all who are neither parties to a judgment nor privies to such\\nparties. are wholly free from the estoppel of the judgment. This rule is firmly\\nimbedded in our own law as is attested by a multitude of decided cases. * * *\\nIt contravenes the first principles of justice to hold a man bound by a judgment\\nagainst which he has neither an opportunity to defend or notice in any way that\\nlie was to be directly involved in its consequences.\\'\\nh\\'is rule is more clearly stated perhaps in Freeman on Judgments. section\\n162: -- No grantee can be bound by any judgment in an action commenced\\nagainst his grantor subsequent to the grant: otherwise a mian having no interest\\ni n property could defeat the estate of the true owner.\\'\\nIn Black v. Black. 62 Texas, 290. in passing upon a question of parties similar\\nto the one under consideration, the court said: -- Nor is the title or claim there\\nadmitted to be held by them (that is the subsequent vendees) to the land in ques-\\ntion in the least degree affected by the proceedings had by the appellant against\\nIlargrove and wife, so far as is disclosed bv the record now before us for consid-\\neration. In cases of this character, after the foreelosure of a deed of trust, or\\na mortgage. or a vendor\\'s lien. or like claim on real estate. it has been repeatedly\\nlIeld by this court that persons holding the relation to the subject matter in\\ncontrovers sustained by the appellant and her husband in this suit (that is\\nthe vendees of the original purchaser of the land) are in the verv nature ofIthings necessary parties to the foreelosure suit and the decree there rendered.\"\\nIn Foster v. Powers. 64 Texas. 247. Chief Justice Willie. delivering the opin-\\niou of the court said: -\\'No person can be divested of title to his property\\nill a suit between other parties of which he has no legal notice, and a judgment\\nroudered in such a suit is not binding upon him and is not admissible in evidenceagainst him in any future proceeding in which the title to the property is inControversy.\"\\nTo the same effect is Morrison v.

This\\ncan not be doubted. The act, it is true, provides that the purchase shall be made\\nby the Penitentiary Board. but, for obvious reasons, the purchase is for the\\nState, and provision is made for the payment of the debt thus created with the\\nreveniue of the State. The inhibitioin is against the creation of a debt by or on\\nbehalf of the State. The school fund is devoted exclusively to the support and\\nmaintenance of the public free schools. It can not be lawfully used for any other\\npurpose, though it may be invested in the securities named or provided for in\\nthe Constitution.\\nArticle VII, section 4.\\nIn this case the State offers and is authorized to borrow three hundred thous-\\nand dollars of the fund, and the question is, is it such a debt as may be created.\\nThe power of the State to create a debt is by section 49 of article III of the Con-\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available\\n\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='5b48ce16-8213-49f5-81ab-394941c5d655', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '44', 'file_name': 'texasLaw.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\pythonProjects\\\\RAG_finetuning\\\\explore\\\\..\\\\data\\\\texasLaw.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 5534498, 'creation_date': '2024-11-07', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-07'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 81\\nstitution limited to the following language: \"No debt shall be created by or on\\nbehalf of the State, except to supply casual deficiencies of revenue, repel inva-sion, suppress insurrection. defend the State in war. or pay existing debt; and\\nthe debt created to supply defliencieg in the revenue, shall never exceed in the\\naggregate at any one time $200,000.\"\\nIf, then, the debt proposed by said act is permissible under the above clause\\nof the Constitution, the act is valid.

E. Crozier. Esq., Tax Assessor. Cleburne. Texas.\\nDEAR Siit-Your favor of October 14, to the Comptroller. has been referred to\\nthis department for attention and reply. You state that you and the Commis-\\nsioners Court differ as to the compensation to be paid you for assessing the taxes\\nin special school districts. you contending that you are entitled to one per\\ncentum upon the value of the property assessed. and the C6mmissioners Court\\ncontending that you are only entitled to one per centum upon the amount of the\\ntax assessed against the property.\\nYour attention is called to section 48 of the act of 1893, regulating the public\\nfree schools of this State. The latter clause of said section provides that the\\ntax assessor shall receive a commission of one per centumn for assessing such tax,\\nand the tax collector a commission of one per centum for collecting the same.\\nYou will readily see that if the one per centumn to be paid the assessor is to be\\none per centum upon the value of the property assessed. you will be entitled to\\nreceive one dollar upon every hundred dollars worth of property situated in the\\ndistrict, whereas the law only authorizes a school district to levy a tax of twenty\\ncents on the one hundred dollars. You would thus be receiving five times as\\nmuch as the highest limit that could be levied on the district, and the district\\nwould of course come out very largely in debt. It is clear that the Legislature\\nin the language used intended that you should receive only one per centum upon\\nthe amount of the tax assessed against the district. To illustrate, if the district\\nhas fifty thousand dollars in taxable property and a tax of twenty cents is levied\\non each one hundred dollars, one thousand dollars would be the amount of the\\ntax assessed against the property and you would be entitled to receive one per\\ncent upon the thousand dollars assessed for the district. It is true the com-\\npensation is small, but the contrary construction could not be given the language\\nA.

Sayles\\' Statutes,.provides for the manner of contesting such elec-\\ntions. but this article was declared unconstitutional by our Supreme Court in\\nHarrell v. Lynch.. 65 Texas, 146. It is therefore without force except in so faras it may aid in the construction of the statute bearing upon the question at bar,\\nas showing the legislative intent at the time of the passage of the act relative to\\nremoving county seats in 1879.\\nArticle 700. supra, also provides that such elections shall be conducted as near\\n-as may be as elections for county officers. The provision reasonably includes the\\nmanner of making returns and counting the same as well as other duties imposed\\nupon officers holding an election for county officers..\\nNo case is found or shown wherein our Supreme Court has passed upon the\\n-question presented. In Worsham v. Richards, 46 Texas, 441, it wasiheld by our\\nSupreme Court that the duty of ascertaining whether or not a place was within\\nfive miles of the geographical center of a county should be performed by the\\nCounty Court, and that in the event of fraudulent votes the matter could be\\nproperly contested before that court. notwithstanding no provision -for contest\\nwvas in the law as It then existed. Since that decision the law has been in many\\nmaterial respects amended, with a legislative view, no doubt, to meet the objec-\\ntions to the old law pointed out in that opinion. It could scarcely be considered\\nas an authority even by analogy under the present law. the County Court as then\\nconstituted being entirely different from our present County Courts, and also\\nour entire election system having been changed. The law. as it now is, does not\\n-confer upon the county judge any authority or jurisdiction to sit in a contest of\\nsuch an election. Nor is it believed that such authority can reasonably be in-\\nferred from that given, for that, the legislative mind is clearly expressed that\\nthe contest shall be elsewhere held. Article 702. supra.\\nThis is further made to appear by the amendment to article V. section 8, of\\nthe Constitution, adopted September 22, 1891. Under said section, prior to\\namendment, there was no jurisdiction conferred upon the District Court of such\\ncontested elections. The amendment expressly confers upon the District Court\\nthe original jurisdiction -of contested elections.\" It is believed. therefore, that\\nthe county judge has no jurisdiction in any capacity of a contest of such elec-\\ntion, and can. therefore. perform only the mipisterial duties imposed upon him\\nby statute as the returning officer of such election, the election in this case hav-\\ning been ordered by that officer. The rule as to a returning officer\\'s duty is thus\\nstated: \" They must receive and count the votes as shown by the returns, and\\nthey can not go behind the returns for any parpose.\" McCrary on Elections, sec-\\ntion 82.\\nThe same author, section 84. says: \" The doctrine that canvassing boards and\\nreturn judges are ministerial officers, possessing no discretionary or judicial\\npower, is settled in nearly or quite all theStates.\" Thesepropositionshavemany\\ncases cited under them which fully support the text.\\n\"\"The duties of county., district and State canvassers are generally ministerial.\\nThey are to determine the result shown by the returns, which are by law made\\nthe basis of their action. Unless authorized by statute, they can not go behind\\nthese returns. In the absence of express legislation to the contrary, the return\\nof the precinct canvassers is conclusive upon the county canvassers, as the re-\\nturn of the county canvassers upon the district or State board. The duty of the\\ncanvassers is to take the returns as presented to them according to law. add them\\nup, and declare the result. * * * The canvassers are to be satisfied of the\\ngenuineness of the returns; that is. that the papers presented to them are not\\nforged or spurious: that they are returns. and are signed by the proper officers;\\nbut when so satisfied. they may not reject any returns because of informalities\\ntherein. or because of illegal or fraudulent practices in the election. The simple\\nd11uty of the canvassing board is to declare the apparent result of the voting.\"Paine on Elections, section 603.- See, also. cases cited by the author.

The\\ncompany is not organized for gain or profit, but to subserve a public purpose\\nwithout charge or remuneration. In view of these and the considerations already\\nadverted to, the purpose of the corporation Is charitable; and that it is purely\\npublic, benefiting alike all the residents of the City of Austin as members of the\\ncorimunity, and excluding all ideas of private gain or profit, cannot admit of\\nquestion.\\nGerke v.

John D. McCall, Coniptroller, Austin.\\nDEAR StR-Your letter of the 17th is received. in which you inquire: -The\\nBoard of. Regents of the University desire to use the amount of matriculation\\nfees for paying salaries, over and above those enumerated on page 146, General\\nLaws 1893, under the head of Medical Branch of University. and also to changethe salary of the provost from $1200, as fixed by the appropriation, to $1500. as\\nadditional duties have been imposed upon him; paying the additional amount of\\n$300 out of the matriculation fund.\\n\"Your opinion is respectfully desired as to whether this department can pay\\nthese salaries.\"\\nThe objection urged to the proposed action of the Board of Regents, It seems,\\nrests upon the suggestion that the salaries of the professors and others connected\\nwith the Medical Branch of the Universitykare fixed by the appropriation act of\\n1893 (pp. 145, 146), especially those of demonstrators of anatomy and physiplogy,\\nprovost and janitor. and that the Board of Regents may not exceed the salaries\\nso fixed. If it be true that the salaries are thus fixed, the conclusion reached\\nnecessarily follows. But such is not believed to be the case. On September 30.\\n1893, you were advised in answer to an inquiry that the \" Legislature appropri-\\nated out of the general revenue the specific sum named for the maintenance and\\nsupport of the Medical Branch. and in addition appropriated the tuition fees the\\nstudents of said University might pay in.\" A careful re-examination of the\\nquestion convinces us that this is the proper construction of the act. for the\\nreasons given. The course proposed by the Board of Regents accords with this_\\nconstruction. If it be held that the specification of it in the act is tantamount\\nto a limitation upon the amount the Regents are authorized to pay for the pur-\\nposes respectively named, it will overthrow this interpretation, and lead logically\\nto the conclusion that the sum to be used for the support and maintenance of the\\nMedical Branch of the University is limited to the amount appropriated out of\\nthe general revenue. Obviously this would destroy that portion of the act ap-\\npropriating the matriculation fees of students supplementary to that taken from\\nthe general revenue. It is a familiar rule that that construction should if pos-\\nsible be adopted which will give effect to every provision of a law.

This act was amended March 11. 1881, but in a particu-\\nlar not pertinent to your inquiry. By the act approved January 22, 1883, it isprovided that all of the public lands heretofore authorized to be sold under thetwo acts above referred to are withdrawn from sale; provided. that nothing con-\\ntained therein shall be construed to return said land to the mass of the public\\ndomain, but the same shall be considered to be reserved for the purposes for\\nwhich said land was originally set apart and designated by said act until theLegislature shall otherwise provide. It would seem from this to be clear that\\nthe public lands situated within the reservation, notwithstanding the fact that\\nthey have been withdrawn from sale, are yet reserved and set apart for the pur-\\nposes named in the act of July 14. 1879. and the amendment referred to. The\\nact of March 29,1889. is entitled \"An act to promote the development of the min-\\ning resources of Texas,\" and has for its purpose the \" sale of all the public school,\\nuniversity, asylum. an d public lands containing valuable mineral deposits.\"\\nSection 10 of the act provides that -any person or association of persons. quali-\\nfled as provided by section 1 of this act. shall have the right to locate and obtain\\na patent on any quantity of these lands containing deposits of coal, iron ore,\\nkaolin. marble, etc.\" The act approved May 2,1893. is an amendment to section\\n10 of the act of March 23, 1889, above referred to. and provides \"that any person\\nshall have the right to purchase and obtain patent, by compliance with this act,\\non any public school. university, asylum, and public lands containing valuable\\ndeposits of kaolin. etc.\" It is understood from your letter that the attempt is to\\npurchase, not public school, university or asylum. but public lands. The term\"public lands\" is no doubt used synonymously witD \"public domain\" which\\nhas been defined by our Supreme Court to be \"unappropriated public domain\"\\n(Day Co. v.

In your first question you state\\nsubstantially, that on the 12th day of February., at the regular term of the Com-\\nmissioners Court, the court duly created the office of county superintendent of\\npublic instruction for the county of Tyler. In pursuance of said act creating\\nsaid office, the court duly appointed a person properly qualified to the office thus\\ncreated; that such person did every act on his part necessary to qualify to said\\noffice, and tendered his bond to the Commissioners Court for approval, and that\\nthe court was thorougly satisfied with the validity of the bond so presented. On\\nthe 17th day of February, after the presentation of the bond, and after the oath\\nof office had been taken by the appointee. the court passed an order to abolish\\nsaid office. About these facts there is no controversy. The question presented\\nis, whetber or not the action taken by the Commissioners Court in the first in-\\nstance, and after the attempted qualification of the appointee. the court had\\nauthority to abolish the office to take effect immediately, or whether or not such\\naction could only take effect after the next election, that being the term for\\nwhich the appointee would be entitled to hold his office.\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available\\n\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='9d948251-6245-4685-903e-9d21116f492a', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '57', 'file_name': 'texasLaw.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\pythonProjects\\\\RAG_finetuning\\\\explore\\\\..\\\\data\\\\texasLaw.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 5534498, 'creation_date': '2024-11-07', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-07'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text=\"94 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\nSection 37 of the act of 1893, regulating the public free schools of this State,\\nprovides for the office of county superintendent of public Instruction. and au-thorizes the County Commissioners Court. when in their judgment they deem it\\nadvisable, to provide for the election of county superintendent of public instruc-\\ntion at each general election, and when the offlee is so created it is the duty ofthe court to appoint a superintendent. who shall perform the duties of such officeuntil a county superintendent shall have been elected as subsequently provided\\nin the act and shall have qualified. Subdivision (i) of said section provides that\\nthe County Commissioners Court shall have power to abolish the office of county\\nsuperintendent of public instruction by an order entered on the minutes of theircourt at a regular term thereof. Subdivision (j) of the same section provides\\nthat when the office is abolished the county superintendent shall serve out the\\nterm for which he was elected. There is perhaps no difference in the status of\\nan officer legally appointed by the Commissioners Court having proper authority\\nto make such appointment and one duly elected by the people at a general elec-\\ntion. It is also well known as a part of the history of this law that this limita-\\ntion upon the authority of the Commissioners Court to abolish the office was to\\nprevent the Commissioners Court from legislating a person out of office who\\nwas objectionable to that body. either personally or otherwise, and it is believed\\nthat the appointment would give the person the same status in the office that an elec-\\ntion would have given him. The question then arises as to whether or not the per-\\nson had been duly appointed to the office; that is. whether his appointment was\\ncomplete or whether it was subject to revocation. The authorities upon this\\npoint are perhaps not in entire accord. The weight of authority. however.\\nseems to be to the effect that where an officer has been appointed by a body con-\\npetent to make the appointment. and has done and stands ready to do all acts re-\\nquired of him in qualifying for the office, the appointment thus made is not\\nsubject to revocation. but is complete in so far as the appointing power is con-\\ncerned.\\nIn the case of State v. Barber., 58 Conn., 76. it was held, that where a joint con-\\nvention of the city council met for the purpose of making an appointment for\\nprosecuting attorney, and a ballot was properly taken, and one person received\\na majority of all the votes cast. and the result was announced by the presiding\\nofficer, and subsequently a motion was made to take another ballot, and some\\nother person was by motion declared elected, it was held that the appointment of\\nthe first person was complete and that he was entitled to the office and entitled to\\nqualify. See also Mechem on Public Officers. section 114, and authorities there\\ncited; Throop on Public Officers, sections 88 and 89. and authorities there cited.\\nFrom these we conclude that the weight of authority is to the effect that the\\nperson having been duly appointed by the Commissioners Court had a definite\\nand well defined term of ollice to fill, extending from the date of his appoint-\\nmnent until the election and qualification of his successor, and that under the\\nstatute he cannot be deprived of the office under the appointment so made until\\nthe expiration of his term. This question, however, has never been passed\\nupon. so far as I can ascertain, in this State, and if the Commissioners Court\\ncontinue to refuse to approve the bond, the appointee would of course have his\\nremedy at law. The question would by that means be definitly and positively\\nsettled.\\nVery respectfully.\\n(Signed) FRANK AN DREWS.\\nOffice Assistant Attorney General.\\nFranchise Tax.-I. 0. 0.

In so far as the establishment of schools\\nis concerned. there can be no question but that the same would be exempt under\\nthe very terms of section 7; but as to whether the practice-of charity and benev-\\nolence. visiting the sick and distressed. caring for. educating, and maintaining the\\nwidows and orphans of deceased Odd Fellows come within the meaning of the\\nterm \" purely public charity \" is a question not so. easy of solution. That the\\npractice of these commendable virtues is charitable there can be no question,but inasmuch as a portion of the dispensation of charity by the order is limited\\nto members of the ordea it is seriously contended that this eliminates the purely\\npublic features of the charity. and renders the institution subject to the payment\\nof the tax. This question has never been decided by the courts of this State, but\\nit has frequently been presented to and decided by the courts of other States, and\\nthe opinions widely differ; some holding that inasmuch as the dispensations of\\ncharity.by such orders are limited to the members of the orders and not open to\\nthe public, such institutions are not for \" purely public charity,\" while other\\ncourts hold that it is not necessary for the institutions to be open to the indeft-\\nnite public, but that if the institution is administered for charity, and not for\\nprivate profit or gain, this gives it the character of a \" purely publifc charity.\"\\nOne of the leading cases holding that such an institution is not for \"purely\\npublic charity\" is the case of Bangor v. Masonic Lodge. 73 Maine. It was there\\nheld that as the lodge was for the mutual benefit and protection, and the end to\\nbe attained private and personal. and its benefits confined to privileged persons\\nand not open to an indefinite public. it could not be considered for \" purely pub-\\nlic charity.\" This case is supported by a strong array of authorities on the same\\nline.\\nFrom the language used by the courts in deciding these cases. we infer that the\\ncharters of the institutions limited the right to dispense charity to members of\\nthe order. It will be noted. however, that the charter of the order under con-\\nsideration does not limit the dispensation of charity to a partictilar class, except\\nin a single case-that is. widows\\' and orphans\\' homes. which are limited to the\\nwidows and orphans of deceased Odd Fellows. In no other instance is its char-\\nity limited to any specified class of persons.\\nBut suppose the right to dispense charity be limited to members of the order\\nexclusively: even then there is a strong array of authorities which hold that the\\ninstitution would be for -purely public charity\\' within the meaning of the\\nstatute exempting such institutions from taxation. For instance, in a case where\\na testatrix in her will provided for the establishment of an orphan asylum.\\nwhose object should be the maintenance of white female children, who had been\\nhaptized in the Episcopal church, and were not less than four nor more than\\neight years of age: thewill further directing that the form of worship should be\\nthat observed and taught in the Episcopal church. it was contended in a suitagainst the orphan asylum to collect the tax. that as the benefits of the institution\\nwere confined to a particular eiumerated class of persons. it was not a \"purely\\npublic charity,\" and was. therefore, subject to taxation.

On appeal. this view was at first sustained by the Su-\\npieme Court.\\nAfterwards, however, a rehearing was granted, and the former judgment was\\nreversed and a judgment entered in favor of the defendant, excepting its prop-\\nerty from taxation. In its final opinion the court, among other things, said:\\n\" It is conceded that the devise has created a charity which is in a sense public,\\nbut it is urgpd that it is not \" purely public.\" Now it must be conceded, and it\\nhas been decided, that the word 1, purely \\'\" is not to have its largest and broadest\\nsignificance when used in this connection. Without doubt an asylum for the\\nsupport of fifty blind men or an equal number of paupers would not be obnoxious\\nto the objection that it was not purely public. A charity for the maintenance\\nof disabled seamen or of aged and infirm stonemasons would undoubtedly be a\\npurely public charity, and so also would a charity for the education and main-\\ntenance of the children of such persons. and if such charity should be limited to\\nthe white female orphan children of such persons between the ages of four and\\neight years, such limitations, though they would greatly restrict the number and\\nclass of beneficiaries, would constitute no objection to the purely public char-\\nacter of the charity. Why, then, would not a charity for the support of poor\\nEpiscopalians. Catholics. Jews or Presbyterians of a State or city be a purely\\npublic charity ? No private gain or profit is subserved: the objects of such a\\ncharity are certain and definite, and the persons benefitted are indefinite within\\nthe specified class. The circumstance that the beneficiaries are to be of a parr\\nticular fa\\' h is only of importance as designating the class. As to the meaning\\nof the v d \" purely,\" when used in this connection. we concur in the construc-\\ntion g\\' by the Supreme Court of Ohio in the case of Gerke v. Purcell, 25 Ohio\\nState, tage 229; that is, \\'when the charity-is public, the exclusion of all idea of\\ngain or private profit is equivalent in effect to the forc4 of the word \" purely\"\\nas applied to \" public charity * in the Constitution.\\' \"\\nSee Burd Orphan Asylum v.

Section 37 of article XVI of the Constitution reads:\\n\" Mechanics. artisans. and material men of every class shall have a lien upon the\\nbuildings and articles made or repaired by them for the value of their labor done\\nthereon, or materiais furnished therefor. and the Legislature shall provide for\\nthe speedy and efficient enforcement of said lien.\"\\nThe law enacted in pursuance of this section now reads, \"Any person or firm,lumber dealers, artisan, laborer, mechanic or sub-contractor. who may labor or\\nfurnish material * * * to erect any house or improvement. or to repair any\\nbuilding or improvement whatever, * * * shall have a lien on such house,buildings. fixtures or improvements. and shall also have a lien on the lot or lots\\nof land necessarily connected therewith.\" This law could not be construed so\\nas to give a lien upon structures such as railroads.\\nTyler Tap Railroad Company v. Driscol. 52 Texas, 13.\\nTherefore if contractors can retain any lien upon railroads, it must be by\\nvirtue of what is known as the \" railroad laborers\\' lien law.\"\\nSection 35, article XVI of the Constitution of 1876 provides: \" The Legisla-\\nture shall, at its first session. pass laws to protect laborers on public buildings.\\nstreets. roads, railroads. canals and other similar public works. against the failure\\nof contractors and sub-contractors to pay their current wages when due. and to\\nmake the corporation. company or individual for whose benefit the work is done,\\nresponsible for their ultimate payment.\"\\nIn pursuance of this section the Legislature of 1879 passed the following law:\\n-All mechanics, laborers and operatives who may have performed labor in the\\nconstruction or repair of any railroad locomotive, car or other equipment to a\\nrailroad. or who may have performed labor in the operating of a railroad, and\\nto whom wages are due and owing, shall hereafter have a lien prior to all others\\nupon such.railroad and its equipments for such wages as are unpaid.\" General\\nLaws. Sixteenth Legislature. page 8.\\nIn construing section 35, article XVI. of the Constitution. the Supreme Court\\nsays, in Tyler Tap R. R. v. Driscol, supra, --We think it manifest that this sec-\\ntion has no reference to contractors or builders, and the law enacted in pursu-\\nance of the section (that is the act of 1879 supra) shows that such is the view\\ntaken of it by the Legislature.\"\\nIn Texas and St. Louis R. R. v. Allen & Humphreys. 1 White and Wilson. sec-\\ntion 568 et seq., the question was raised whether the lien could be retained for\\nteams and tools furnished. The court held that the lien is restricted to personal\\nlabor, and does not embrace teams. tools, etc. In rendering the opinion this\\nlanguage is used: \"The object and purpose of this statute is to secure to me-\\nchanics, laborers. and operatives. and no others. wages due or owing to them for\\nwork and labor done and performed in constructing, repairing. or operating the\\nroad. It is the wages for the individual personal labor of the mechanic. laborer\\nor operative that it has reference to. .It does not extend to work and labor done\\nby others, nor to the use of teams, nor to the ise of tools and implements other\\nthan such as are personally used by the person claiming wages, etc.\\nAtchison v.

John H. Reagan, Chairman Railroad Commission, Austin.\\nDEAR SiR-Your inquiry relative to the repeal of article 4257 of the Revised\\nStatutes by the passage of the act to create the Railroad Commission of Texas,\\nhas been duly considered. Your question is substantially whether or not said\\narticle 4257, in so far as it establishes a maximum rate which may be charged by\\nrailroad companies., is repealed by the act establishing the Railroad Commission.\\nArticle 4257, in so far as it affects the question presented. reads as follows:\\nRailroad companies may charge and receive not exceeding the rate of fifty\\ncents per hundred pounds per hundred miles for the transportation of freight\\nover their roads: but the charges for transportation on each class of freight shall\\nbe uniform. and no unjust discrimination in the rates or charges for the trans-\\nportation of any freight shall be made against any person or place on any rail-\\nroad in this State.\"\\nThe act to establish the Railroad Commission of Texas is entitled \"An act to\\nestablish a Railroad Commission for the State of Texas, whereby discrimination\\nand extortion in railroad charges may be prevented, and reasonable freight and\\npassenger tariffs may be established.,\" etc. Section I establishes the Commission\\nand provides for the appointment of the Couimissioners. Section 2 provides for\\nthe organization of the Commission; and section 3 prescribes the authority and\\ndeclares the duty of the Commission. Subdivision \"a\" of said section confers\\npower upon the Commission to classify and subdivide all freight. and subdivision\\nb\" provides that \"the Commission shall have power and it shall be its duty to\\nfix to each class or subdivision of freight a reasonable rate for each railroad.\\nsubject to the act for the transportation of each of said classes and subdivisions.\"\\nSubdivision \"d\" provides that the Commission may fix different rates for differ-\\nent roads. Subdivision \\'e\" authorizes the Commission to fix rates for connect-ing lines of road. Subdivision \"h\" confers upon the Commissiob the power andduty from time to time to alter. change. amend. or abolish any classification orrate established br it when deemed necessary. Subdivision \\'j\" provides that the\\nCommission shall make reasonable and just rates of charges for each railroad for\\nthe transportation of loaded and empty cars. Section 23 of said act declares thatall laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act are hereby repealed.Under well settled rules of construction, where there is an express repeal of\\nall laws and parts of laws in contlict with an act passed, it is evident that in the\\nlegislative mind there were other laws existing in the State in conflict with theprovisions of the act to which the declaration of repeal is made. It shows there-\\'fore an intention to repeal, and is not in a strict legal sense merely a repeal byimplication.\\nSection 154 of Sutherland on Statutory Construction lays down the followingrule: \" Though a subsequent statute be not repugnant in all its provisions to aformer, yet if it was clearly intended to prescribe the only rule which shouldgovern, it repeals the former statute,\" and in section 155, id., it is said: \" Where\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available\\n', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='596cc118-1af2-4c77-9214-0b74ee9e1ad3', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '62', 'file_name': 'texasLaw.pdf', 'file_path': 'd:\\\\pythonProjects\\\\RAG_finetuning\\\\explore\\\\..\\\\data\\\\texasLaw.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 5534498, 'creation_date': '2024-11-07', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-07'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 90\\nthere are two acts on the same subject. and a later embraces all the provisions of\\nthe first and also new provisions, the later act operates without any repealing\\nclause, as a repeal of the first.\"\\nThese propositions are sustained by numerous authorities.\\nHarris v.

Harris, 44 Texas, 514.\\nTracy v. Tuffy. 134 U. S., 206.\\nAuthorities might be multiplied indefinitely upon this proposition. It seems\\nto us to be clear that the-primary object of the act of April 3. 1891. referred to,\\nwas to confer upon the commission the power to fix reasonable rates. Hereto-\\nfore that power was vested in railroad companies, subject to the limitation pre-\\nscribed in article 4257, that the rates should not exceed fifty cents per hundred\\npounds per hundred miles. If it should be held that the maximum rate therein\\nprescribed was not repealed, it seems that it would follow that the converse of\\nthe proposition would be true, and that the railroads would still be authorized to\\ncharge fifty cents per hundred pounds per hundred miles. It is clear to our\\nminds that the act of April 3. 1891, intended to prescribe, and does prescribe,\\nthe only rule as to freight obtaining in this State, and that article 457, in so far\\nas it fixes the maximum freight rate, is in conflict with the act of April 3, 1891,\\nand is therefore to that extent repealed.\\nSt. Louis Ry. Co. v. Kay. 22 S. W. Rep., 685.\\nIn the last cited case the question was as to whether article 279 of the Revised\\nStatutes was repealed by the act of April 2, 1887. Article 279 refers to all car-\\nriers indiscriminately. The act of April 2. 1887, refers only to railroads. The\\ncourt say that in the case presented there is no necessary inconsistency or re-\\npugnancy between the two statutes. but \" it seems to us that the later statute\\nwas intended to cover the whole field as to railroad companies, and to lay down\\nthe only rule for a recovery against them for the particular wrong it points out.\\nFor these reasons we think article 279. in so far as it relates to railroad corpor-\\nations. is repealed by article 4227.\" (Act of April 2. 1887.)\\nWe believe that the act establishing the Railroad Commission \\'prescribes the\\nonly rule of regulation of freight rates, and that it was intended to cover the\\nwhole subject imatter, and it therefore repeals article 4257 as above indicated.\\nVery respectfully.\\n(Signed) FRANK ANDREWS,\\nOffice Assistant Attorney General.\\nTranscribing County Records.-County clerk is entitled to receive fifteen cents for\\ntranscribing old records of a county under article 4281 of the Revised Statutes.\\nATTORNEY GENERAL\\'S OFFICE,\\nAUSTIN, June 21, 1894.\\nG.

Gustavus. -Madisonville, Texas.\\nDEAR Sim-In reply to your favor &f the 6th instant. wherein you ask if a\\nminor, after having his disabilities removed, is eligible to the office of county\\nattorney. I beg to say article 3361a, Sayles\\' Statutes, provides that after the re-\\nmoval of the disabilities of minority. said minor shall be deemed and held for\\nall legal purposes of full age. and shall be held responsible, and shall have all\\nthe privileges and advantages as if he were of full age. saving only that he shall\\nnot vote until he arrives at the age of twenty-one years. You will note that the\\nConstitution requires that a person shall be twenty-one years of age in order to\\nvote. but there is no such provision with reference to holding the office of county\\nattorney. Articles 249 and 251, Sayles\\' Statutes, provide that the county attor-\\nney shall be duly licensed to practice law in the District Courts of this State.\\nand shall reside in the county for which be was elected. There is no provision\\nof law nor clause in the Constitution which requires a county attorney to be\\ntwenty-one years old. This being the case, we conclude that after the removal\\nof the disabilities of a minor, and after he.hwelseen duly licensed to practice law\\nin the District Courts of this State, atrd\\'Isf idiident of the county, he is eligible\\nto the office of county attorney. , I\\nIn discussing this question our court used the following language: \" Eligi-\\nbility to oflice is not declared as a right or principle by any express terms of the\\nConstitution, but it rests as a just deduction from the express powers and pro-\\nvisions of the system. The basis of the principle is the absolute liberty of the\\nelectors and the appointing authorities to choose and appoint any person who is\\nnot made ineligible by the Constitution. Eligibility to office belongs, therefore,\\nnot exclusively or specially to electors enjoying the right of suffrage. It belongs\\nequally to all persons whomsoever not excluded by the Constitution. When a\\nConstitution has been framed which contains no provision defining in terms who\\nshall be eligible to office, there is strength in the argument that the intention was\\nto confide the selection to the untrammeled will of the electors. Experience\\nteaches us that in popular elections those only are chosen who are in sympathy\\nwith the people both in thought and aspiration.\"\\nSteusoff v.

      "[\"38 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\nOPINIONS.\\nAs being of general importance or interest the following opinions have-\\nbeen selected for publication from the large number rendered:\\nCommissions of County Treasurer.-County treasurer is entitled to receive a com-\\nmission of one-half of one per cent on money coming into his hands as permanent\\nschoolfund of a county. and is also entitled to a like commission for disbursing\\nthis fund. CountU treasurer is also entitled to receive commissions on the pro-\\nceeds of countU bonds issued for the purpose of making improvements and turned\\nover to the contractor.\\nATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE.\\nAU$TIN. December 10. 1892.\\nAlexander Coker, Esq.. County Treasurer, Oakville. Texas.\\nDEARt SIR-Replying to your favor of December S., I bag to state that the\\nquestions you ask have already been considered in reply to a letter from thecounty judge of your county. To reiterate. you are entitle(] to charge coniuis-\\nsions of one-half of one per cent on money coming into your hands as permanent\\nschool fund of the county: you are also entitled to a like commission for dis-\\nbursing this fund. A mere transfer of money from one fund to another. without\\npaving it out. is not a disbursement. The commissions are not to be paid out of\\nthe permanent school fund. but must be paid out of the available school fund of\\nthe county.\\nGeneral Laws Twenty-second Legislature. page 142.\\nIn answer to your second question. it has been held that where county bonds\\nissued for the purpose of making public improvements are sold an( the proceeds\\nturned over to the contractor. the county treasurer is entitled to receive a coim-\\nmission: in such case it may be that the treasurer does not actually handle the\\nmoney. but lie is held to be the proper custodian of county funds an( should be\\npermitted to handle the proceeds of the bonds, and is held, therefore, to be enti-\\ntied to commissions on the amount.\\nWall v. McConnell, 65 Texas, 401.\\nOn the other hand. it is held that where county bonds are issued and are not\\nsold, but are paid directly to the contractor. the county treasurer is not entitled\\nto commissions. The Supreme Court makes the distinction between these two\\nclasses of transactions very clear. and it is of the opinion that county treasurers\\nare no more entitled to receive commissions on bonds paid directly to the con-\\ntractor than he would be to receive a commission on a promissory note or other\\nevidence of pecuniary obligation issued by the county to the contractor.\\nMcKinney v. Robinson. 19 S. W. Reporter. 899.\\nYou are respectfully advised. therefore, that under the facts stated by you. you\\nare not entitled to a commission on the bonds issued by the county and regis-\\ntered by you.\\nVery respectfully,\\n(Signed) R. L. BATTS,\\nOffice Assistant Attorney General.\\nSureties on Official Bonds.-It is against public policy for a county commissioner to\\nbecomhe suorotl on the bond of any county officer.\\nATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE.\\nAUSTIN, December 13, 1892.\\nC. L. Goodman. Esq.. County Clerk. Orange, Texas.\\nDEAR Sm-Your favor of December 9 is received. You state that two com-\\nmissioners of your county are sureties on the bond of the treasurer for the gen-\\neral fund of your county, and also upon the bond of the treasurer for the county\\nschool fund. You state that the commissioners court desire an opinion from this\\ndepartment as to whether said bond should be approved.\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available\", 'REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 39\\nArticle 1912, Sayles\\' Statutes, prescribes that before entering upon the duties\\nof his office the county judge and each commissioner-shall take the oath of officeprescribed by the Constitution. and also take an oath that he shall not be, directlyor indirectly, interested in any contract with or claim against the county in\\nwhich lie resides, except such warrants as may issue to him as fees of office. It\\nis the duty of the commissioners court to approve the bond of the treasurer forthe general fund.\\nArticle 988. Revised Statutes.\\nIt is the duty of the county judge to approve his bond for the school fund.Article 989. Revised Statutes.\\nThere is no statute which expressly prohibits a county commissioner from being\\na surety on the bond of any county officer. though it is believed that such action\\nis in contravention of the obvious public policy of this State. All safeguards that\\ncan be are thrown around the commissioners, so that they may never be placed\\nin any position where a commissioner would have as an individual any interest\\nadverse to the commissioner as an officer. or in other wvords, any interest adverse\\nto the constituency he represented. It has been held that the act of approving a\\nbond by the commissioners court is a judicial act. Murfree on Official Bonds.\\nsection 51. Our Constitution and laws prohibit judges from sitting in any case\\nin which they are interested. or to which they are a party, and prohibit various\\nofficers of the court from practicing law in the court. and prohibit district and\\ncounty attorneys from representing any interest adverse to the State. The gen-\\neral public policy of this State is. that its otlkers who represent it shall represent\\nno interest adverse to it. and the same rule would he applicable to counties. It\\ncan readily be seen where the interest of a commissioner who was surety for a\\ntreasurer would be in direct conflict with the interest of the county in case of a\\ndefault by the treasurer, and we have a very high authority for saying that no\\none can serve two masters.\\nYou are therefore advised that while not expressly prohibited by statute. it is\\nnot believed to be permitted under the public policy of this State and the inter-\\nests involved for the county comnmissioners to become sureties of the treasurer\\'s\\nbond in and for the county for which they are the acting commissioners.\\nVery respectfully.\\nFRANK( ANDREWS.\\nOtlice Assistant Attorney General.\\n(onstitutional Lau.-Articles maqrked 2589a and 25896 of theolrst section of chapter\\n70 of the General Laws of the Spectal Session of the Twenty-second Legislatuire\\n1892) are not unconstititional as confltictinU ecith section 40, article III of the\\nConstitution of 187t.\\nATTORNEY GENERAL S OFFICE.\\nAUSTIN. )ecember 22. 1892.\\nlon. S. S. Hanscom. County Judge. Galveston. Texas:\\nDEAR Sm-Your letter of l)ecember 10 was duly received. The pressure of\\nbusiness that could not be postponed has been so great that it has been impossi-\\nble to give it earlier attention.\\nThe question you submit might be thus stated: Are articles marked 2589a and\\n2589b of the first section of \"An act to amend article 2578.\" etc.. published at\\nchapter 10. General Laws Special Session Twenty-second Legislature. constitu-\\ntional? To the subject of these articles no reference is made in the proclamation\\nof the Governor. In his regular message to the Legislature upon the convening\\nof that body he used the following language:\\n\\'ale of Estates\\nUnder existing law real property under administration or guardianship can\\nnot be sold on longer time than twelve months under such conditions as to very\\nmuch embarrass such estates. It would be well to permit real estate to be sold\\non a longer time with good security under suitable restrictions. so that vast\\nestates now, or that may hereafter bd, controlled by administrators and guardians\\nwill not be sacrificed.\"\\nThe law passed in response to this portion of the message was entitled \"An act\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', '40 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\nto amend article 2578 and article 2581 of chapter 10 of the.Revised Statutes of\\nthe State of Texas, and to add thereto article 2589a, providing for a hypotheca-\\ntion of lands belonging to an estate in the hands of a guardian. and article 2589b\\nproviding for the novation of existing indebtedness of estates in guardianship.*\\'\\nThis title describes the conditions of the bill.\\nThe entire law is valid unless it comes in conflict with the following provision\\nof the Constitution: -,When the Legislature shall be convened in special session.\\nthere shall be no legislation upon subjects other than those designated in the\\nproclamation of the Governor calling such session, or presented to them by the\\nGovernor.\" Section 40. article IlI. Constitution 1870.\\nIn Baldwin v.

Such a rule would virtually\\nabrogate all constitutional limitations on legislative actions. The citations do\\nnot go further than to question the right of the judiciary to determine the regu-\\nlarity of legislative proceedings: they do not undertake to limit the courts in an\\ninquiry as to the primary authority of the Legislature. But the Court of Ap-\\npeals has. since the promulgation of the opinion above cited. even held that the\\nconstitutional rules as to procedure are mandatory. and that if it should appear\\nthat these rules have not been observed inh the passage of a bill. the law would\\nbe held unconstitutional.\\nHunt v. State. 22 Court Appeals. 396.\\nThe constitutionality of the law or any part of it can thenhe questioned. but\\nin the determination of the matter here involved the following rules must be\\nconsidered:\\nNothing but a clear violation of the Constitution, a clear usurpation of power\\nprohibited, will justify the judicial department in pronouncing an act of the\\nlegislative department unconstitutional and void.\\nRailroad Company v. Riblette. 06 Penn.. 184.\\nCourts \" never declare a statute void unless the nullity and invalidity of the\\nact are placed, in their judgment. beyond a reasonable doubt.

The argument should amount\\nalmost to a demonstration. If doubt exists, the act should be sustained,-the\\npresumption is in favor of its validity.Sarony v. Burrow. 17 Fed. Rep.. 591\\'.\\nIn view of these rules, the burden will be upon the party attempting to dem-\\nonstrate the invalidity of the law. The matter of articles 2589a and 2589b will be\\nconsidered within the -subject presented\" to the Legislature. in the paragraph\\nheretofore quoted. if it may be considered at all presented. inasmuch as there is\\nno other subject in the proclamation or any message of the Governor remotely\\nrelating to the property of guardian ship and administrations.\\nThe Governor announces as the subject of the paragraph referred to \" Sale of\\nEstates.\" A mortgage was primarily at common law understood to be a sale of\\nreal estate which became inoperative or nugatory upon the happening of pre-\\nscribed conditions.

Indeed,\\nit is not difficult to imagine a case in which articles 2578 and 2581, as amended.\\nwould be entirely useless and inoperative. or entirely unjust to the creditor of\\nthe estate in the absence of some such authority as is conferred in articles 259Sa\\nand 2598b.\\nWhen a sale is made upon the long time allowed by the statute, must a creditor4\\nwait until the notes executed become due before he can receive amounts alreadv\\npayable? Or, if a creditor must wait. shall he be barred by the statute-of limi-\\ntations because there is no authority in anyone to renew the evidence of indebt-\\nedness which he holds?\\nIn view of these considerations, it appears that a court would not be withoutwarrant in holding that a mortgage of property to pay or secure debts. or the\\nnovation of evidence of debts, is not excluded from the subjects presented to the\\nLegislature in the paragraph headed \" Sale of Estates.\\nThe statute considered is certainly as much entitled to that construction as the\\none under consideration in Baldwin v. State. heretofore cited. in which it was\\nheld that the words -to redeem the taxes, both ad valorem and occupation. so far\\nas it may be found consistent with\\'the support of an efficient State government\"\\nwas held to embrace the entire subject of taxation. and to warrant the passage of\\na law placing anl occupation tax upon persons engaged in selling certain papers.\\nIn the case of 1)evereux v. City of Brownsville, 29 Federal Reporter. 742. the\\npiestion arose under a similar constitutional provision as to whether or not.\\nunder a call \" to enable taxing districts to compromise their old debts,\" an act\\nwhich repealed former grants of power to levy taxes to pay these debts, was con-\\nstitutional. In the discussion of this case the court says: \" It was not the in-\\ntention to require the Governor to define with precision, as to details, the sub-\\njects of legislation. jut only in a general way by his call to confine the business\\nto particular subjects. Mitchell v. Turnpike Co.. 3 Humph.. 455. Too great\\nlatitude of construction might. undoubtedly. abrogate the restriction of the Con-\\nstitution: but. on the other hand, a too rigid requirement in this regard would\\ndisastrously embarrass the Executive and the Legislature, since the former could\\nnever, with accuracy. foretell what the legislative mind would adopt as pertinent\\nto the general subject. and therefore could not specifically define the provisions\\nor even the special character of the forthcoming legislation. while the latter\\ncould not always. if ever, determine with accuracy what might or might not be\\nof too remote aflinity with the call. Besides. it would be conferring legislative\\npowers never contemplated by the Constitution to permit him to restrict the\\nLegislature as to the details or character of its enactments.\"\\nThe Legislature has construed tihe paragraph under consideration: the Gov-\\nernor. 1 his approval of the bill, has at least acquieseed in that construction.\\nThe correct rule of construction by the Legislature is that no law should be\\npassed if there is a doubt of its constitutionality: the correct rule of construc-\\ntion by a court is that no law should be declared unconstitutional unless it is\\nclearly so.\\nThe question you present can not be put beyond doubt except by an adjudica-\\ntion of a court of last resort. but it appears to me that a liberal construction of\\na latitudinous rule would enable the court to hold that all of the law under con-\\nsideration is constitutional.\\n& Very respectfully.\\n(Signed) VR.

D. Varnell, Esq.. Counit Attorney, Clarksville. Texas.\\nDI)AR SmH-Replying to your favor of the l8th instant. in which you ask if\\nthe sureties on the recognizance of Tom Lowrance are liable, his appeal hav-\\ning been dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeals because no notice of appeal\\nappeared in the record. you are respectfully advised. that in the opinion of this-\\ndepartment the sureties are liable. The fact that appellant failed to give and\\nhave entered of record the required notice of appeal to confer jurisdiction on the\\nCourt of Criminal Appeals. will in no manner lessen the liability of him and his\\nsureties on his recognizance; he could not. thus. by his own laches and neglect.\\nrelieve himself of a valid judgment of your County Court. If the Court of Crimi-\\nnal Appeals\\'had acquired jurisdiction and afirmel the cas and he then failed\\nto appear in accordance with the conditions of his recognizance. then. under all\\nthe authorities, the sureties would be liable. In a case like this, when no affirm-\\nance is had. but the appeal is simply dismisse( with the order that the appellant\\npay the costs of appeal. there is no statutory direction as to the procedure in such\\na case, nor is there any decision by our appellate court which indicates the rule.\\nThen, in view of the silence of the statute and the absence of judicial construe-\\ntion, it can not be said that the question presented is altogether free from doubt:\\nit is not believed. however, that the mere silence of the statute in the precise\\nquestion indicated will leave the State without remedy when the defendant fails\\nto appear before the trial court -- from day to day and term to term an( not de-\\npart without leave of the court. in order to abide the judgment of tihe Court of\\nCriminal Appeals.- Where the defendant fails to appear, as in this case. his\\nrecognizance should he forfeited under article 440 et seq.. Code of Criminal Pro-\\ncedure. In case this is done the sureties will no doubt contend that under article\\n875. Code of Criminal Procedure. the right to forfeit a recognizance on appeal is\\nlimited to cases of allirmance of the judgment of the trial court, and that in all\\ncases other than an affirmance the bail bond is the obligation to proceed upon.\\nThis position seems to be supported by the case of Wells v. State. 21 Court of\\nAppeals. 594. We think, however, a dismissal under the circumstances stated is\\ntantamount to an affirmnance.\\nThe dismissal of the appeal is an afflirmation of the judgment below.\" State\\nv. Biesmuan (-Montana). 29 Pacific Reporter, 534. We therefore conclude that the\\ndoctrine announced in Wells v. State. supra. will not be held to extend to cases\\nwhere there is a judgnient of the Court of Appeals to be performed; the Wells\\ncase was reversed and no judgment of any kind was rendered against appellant.\\nThis case stands different: there is a juildgmnent of the Court of Appeals to be per-\\nformed, viz., payment of the cost of appeal. Then how shall that judgment be\\nperformed ? Evidently the law does not contemplate that it can be performed\\nin any other manner than that stipulated by the terms of his recognizance. i. e..\\nappearance before the trial court and payment of the judgment. .\"All bonds aid\\nrecognimizances for appearance to answer the charge of the State are intended to\\nsecure the trial of the offender rather than to mulet tile sureties.\" Jackson v.\\nState, 13 Texas, 218.\\nIn this case the offender has been tried and judgment rendered, but said ju(g-\\nment was suspended by entering into a recognizance. the conditions of which\\nevidently intend an ultimate performance of the judgment unless it is reversed\\nan( unless the principal literally complies with all the conditions of the recog-\\nnizance. both in manner and form as conditioned. the sureties are liable. and the\\nonly way to avoid liability is to bring the case within the exceptions enumerated\\nin article 452.', 'i. e..\\nappearance before the trial court and payment of the judgment. .\"All bonds aid\\nrecognimizances for appearance to answer the charge of the State are intended to\\nsecure the trial of the offender rather than to mulet tile sureties.\" Jackson v.\\nState, 13 Texas, 218.\\nIn this case the offender has been tried and judgment rendered, but said ju(g-\\nment was suspended by entering into a recognizance. the conditions of which\\nevidently intend an ultimate performance of the judgment unless it is reversed\\nan( unless the principal literally complies with all the conditions of the recog-\\nnizance. both in manner and form as conditioned. the sureties are liable. and the\\nonly way to avoid liability is to bring the case within the exceptions enumerated\\nin article 452.

Unless\\none of these things had licen done. we are of opinion that the sheriff has no right\\nto arrest the defendant on the original charge. The recognizance stands for the\\nappearance pf the defendant, and until the same is forfeited or the necessary afft-\\ndavit made under article 300 Code of Criminal Procedure, the sheriff has no right\\nto arrest him. \" When a surety desires to release himself from liability, the law\\nprovides the manner in which he may accomplish it. and the modes provided\\nmust be strictly complied with.\\'\\nRoberts v.

January 12. 1893.\\n.Jaies D. Farmer. Esq.. Registrar. Fort Worth. Texas.\\nDEAR Sm-Replying to your favor of the 10th instant. in which you state that\\nupon petition of five hundred citizens the registration law for cities over ten\\nthousand inhabitants was put in force for the last general election in the city of\\nFort Worth. and ask whether that is sufficient to make the law operative, in the\\ncoming municipal election, or whether another petition of live hundred citizens\\nis necessary. you are respectfully advised that in order to put said law in force\\nand make it govern in the coming municipal election it is necessary that a peti-\\ntion signed by five hundred citizens. asking for registration. be first presented\\nto your commissioners\\' court. The fact that such\\' petition was granted and the\\nlaw put in force for the last general election is not sufficient to continue the law\\nin force after such election.-- This conclusion follows from the language of the\\nact providing for registration. So much of said act as is necessary to a decision\\nof the questions presented by you reads as follows: \" There shall. upon the\\npetition of five hundred citizens of such city. be. prior to each general election.\\neither State. county, or municipal. had a registration of all voters in said city.\"\\nSection 1. p. 13. General Laws, first called session Twenty-second Legislature.\\nThis language clearly indicates that such petition is necessary -prior to each\\ngeneral election.\" If the Legislature intended that the law should continue in\\noperation after having been put in force. we apprehend that the above language\\nwould not appear in the act. Again, there is considerable expense incurred by\\nthe enforcement of the registration act. This expense is paid out of the general\\nfund of the county in State-and county elections, and out of the general fund of\\nthe city in city elections. Section 10. p. 14. General Laws first called session\\nTwenty-first Legislature. lt is not believed that a petition for registration in-a\\ngeneral State and county election will put the registration act in motion and\\nef\\'ect as to city elections. and thereby create a charge upon the revenue of the\\ncity for the expense of conducting registration in a municipal election; but it is\\nthe opinion of this department that when registration is desired in a municipal\\nelection, the proper petition therefor should be presented as required by section\\n1 above quoted. This it seems would be necessary in order to constitute a charge\\nupon the general funds of the city for the payment of the expense of conducting\\nregistration. It is the evident purpose of the registration act to permit cities of\\nten thousand inhabitants to invoke its provisions when desired. but not to force-\\nthem to accept same in all elections, whether State or municipal. You are-\\ntherefore, respectfully advised that unless five hundred citizens of your city-\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', '44 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\npresent a petition to the commissioners\\' court of Tarrant county, asking for\\nregistration in the coming municipal election, the registration law can not be\\nenforced in such election.\\nVery respectfully,\\n(Signed) cMANN TRICE,\\nOffice Assistant Attorney General.\\nSheriffs\\' Fees.-A shoritr cannot charge five cents for mileage actually traveled in\\nposting two notices of sale at two public places other than the court house door in\\ncases of sale of land by public execution.\\nATTORNEY GENERAN OFFICE,\\nAUSTIN, January 30, 1893.\\nHen.

Another clause of article 2396 provides a fee of\\none dollar for posting the advertisement for sale under execution or any order\\nof sale.

Travis Henderson, Chairman Finance Conmittee, House Representatives.\\nDEAR? Smt-Jn response to your verbal inquiry, 1 have made a careful investi-\\ngation of the question as to whether or not the Constitution, article 5. section 2,as amended September 22, 1891, fixes absolutely the salaries of the justices of the\\nSupreme Court of this State and the salaries of the judges of the Court of Crimi-\\nnal Appeals at four thousand dollars. Said section provides that the ChiefJustice and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court \" shall each receive an\\nannual salary of four thousand dollars, until otherwise provided by law.\" Sec-\\ntion 4 of said amended article provides that the judges of the Court of Criminal\\nAppeals shall have the same qualifications and receive the same salaries of the\\njudges of the Supreme Qourt. The question. tersely stated, would be. whether\\nthis provision of the Constitution is self-executing and fixes the salaries of these\\notlicers by its own terms, or whether legislation is necessary in order to fix the\\nsame. 7\\nThe Constitution of 1876, article 5. section 2, provided that the Chief Justice\\nand Associate Justices shall each receive an annual salary of not more than $3550.\\nThere was no statute regulating the salaries of these officers, and an annual ap-\\npropriation. in obedience to the terms of the Constitution. of 93550 has been\\nmade since its adoption for each of said officers. The amendment above quoted,\\nwhich was declared adopted September 22, superseded the Constitution of 1876,\\nand became. at the time of its adoption, the controlling law, and determined and\\nfixed the salaries of these officers at four thousand dollars per annum until other-\\nwise provided by the Legislature.\\nIn the case of Watson v. Aiken, 55 Texas, 536, a similar constitutional pro-\\nvision was held to be self-executing, regarding the legal rate of inte\\'rest. Sec-\\ntion 11, article XVI. of the Constitution provided substantially that all interest\\ncharged above 12 per cent shall be deemed usurious and the Legislature shall at\\nits first session provide appropriate pains and penalties to punish usury. In the\\nabove case it was held that any contract for a greater rate of interest than 12 per\\ncent was illegal, and that the interest could not be collected, notwithstanding\\nthat the Legislature had enacted no law providing appropriate pains and penal-\\nties. In the case submitted the amended Constitution is the only law now in\\nexistence which fixes the salaries of the justices of the Supreme Court. and it is\\nthe paramount law and needs no legislative action to give it force.

Pugh, addressed to you, in which he asks how\\nbe can be released from a saloon bond. referredoby you to this department, is re-\\nceived.\\nYou are respectfully advised that there is no provision of law which author-\\nizes the release of a surety on the bond mentioned. Section 4. page 59, of the\\nact of 1887. provides that any person engaging in the sale of spirituous. vinous\\nor malt liquors shall, before engaging in such occupation. be required to enter\\ninto a bond in the sum-of five thousand dollars, with at least two good and suffli-\\ncient sureties. Said act further provides. in addition to civil proceedings for\\nindividual injuries brought on said bond, that if the principal shall violate any\\nof the conditions of the bond the district or county attorney may institute suit\\nthereon in the name of the State for the use and benefit of the county., and the\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', '48 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\namount of five hundred dollars shall be recovered from the principal and sure-\\nties upon any breach of the conditions thereof.\\nWe infer from the letter that the principal on the bond in question has violated\\nits provisions; if notice of this fact is brought to the district or county attorney\\nin the district where the saloon is located, he wpuld no doubt immediately insti-\\ntute suit for a breach of its conditions. In the event of such breach we know of\\nno provision of law which would release the surety from liability. Will say,\\nhowever, that section 5 of said act provides: -If any county clerk shall issue a\\nlicense to any dealer in intoxicating liquors, without first requiring the bond\\nprovided for in this act, lie shall be fined not less than one hundred nor more\\nthan five hundred dollars.\" Under this provision this department holds that at\\nthe expiration of the time for which license was issued. it is necessary for a new\\nhond to be filed and approved.

The contention appears to be that articles 423 and 424 of the Revised\\nCivil Statutes require the Comptroller to register bonds which have been for-\\nwarded to him accompanied by a statement of the taxable values and tax levies.\\nwithout regard to the validity of the bonds or the legality of the tax levies.\\nArticle 42:3 provides: \\'\\' It shall be the duty of the mayor, whenever any bond\\nor bonds are issued, to forward the same to the Comptroller of Public Accounts\\nof the State. whose duty it shall be to register said bond or bonds in a book kept\\nfor that purpose. and to endorse on each bond so registered his certificate of\\nregistration. and to give at the request of the mayor his certificate certifying to\\nthe amount of bonds so registered in his office up to (late.\"\\nWithout. in this connection. considering article -124 at all. it is apparent that\\nthere devolves primarily upon the Comptroller the necessity of determining if\\nbonds had been issued by the city, If his duties be considered as entirely minis-\\nterial. there still devolves upon him the necessity of arriving at a conclusion as\\nto whether or not circumstances have arisen which would require the exercise of\\nhis official functions. It is certainly not every piece of lithographed paper that\\nmay be forwarded to the Comptroller that must be registered. The mere circum-\\nstance that the mayor and secretary of a city sign a piece of paper, upon which\\nis printed a recitation to the effect that the city will pay so much to bearer at a\\ndesignated time, does not create an obligation against the city, and does not\\nmake a bond issued by the city. A counterfeit presentment of a dollar is not a\\ndollar; a lithographed recitation of obligation, signed without authority, is not\\nan obligation: a putative bond issued without warrant of law is not a bond.\\nMore than the mere signature of officers is required; there must be authority to\\nsign.

A bond is evidence of indebtedness. Upon the existence of the debt the\\nexistence of the bond is dependent.\\nIn the case of Bank v. Terrell, 78 Texas, 450, this language is used: \" While\\nour Constitution authorizes the creation of a debt * * * its mandate is im-\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', 'REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 49\\nperative that no such debt shall be created without making provision at the time\\nof its creation to assess and collect annually a suficient sum to pay interest thereon\\n,and create a sinking fund of at least two per cent on the principal. Until this is\\ndore the debt is not created and none exists.\"\\nThe action of the Comptroller is predicated upon the issue by a city of bonds;\\nthe bonds are dependent upon the creation of a debt; the debt is dependent upon\\ncompliance with the constitutional requirements regarding the levy of taxes. Ifit should appear to the Comptroller that no adequate tax levy has been made.\\nwould it also not appear that no duty devolved upon him with reference to what\\nmerely purported to be bonds of the city?\\nOne of the purposes which article 423 evidently intended to accomplish was to\\ngive notice to the world of the obligations outstanding of the city; it was to\\nbenefit alike the investing public and the debtor city. The former could examine\\nthis record in an investigation of a contemplated investment, the latter could\\nexhibit it as evidence that the authority of the city to issue bonds had not been\\nexceeded. The book of registration would serve much the same purpose with\\nregard to cities that the mortgage record of a county would with regard to an\\nindividual. If the construction contended for should be given, this salutary pur-\\npose of the law would be defeated, and instead of giving notice of the obligations\\nof the city, the certificate would. at least until it became understood that regis-\\ntration was merely nonsense prescribed by law, serve as an instrument to aid un-\\nscrupulous oflicials to defraud the innocent and unsuspecting.\\nBut registration was intended to more than merely give notice of the amount\\nof city bonds issued. The certificate placed upon the bond was expected to per-\\nform a still more important function. It was to be evidence that the bond upon\\nwhich it had been placed had been brought to the attention of an officer charged\\nthenceforth with the duty of seeing that the purchaser of the bond be paid the\\ninterest thereon as it fell due., and that provision be made for the payment of the\\nprincipal. Article 424 is to the effect, -that it shall be the duty of the mayor at\\nthe time of forwarding any of said bonds for registration, to furnish the Comp-\\ntroller with a statement of the value of all taxable property. real and personal,\\nin the city: also, with a statement of the amount of tax levied for the-\\'payment\\nof interest and to create a sinking fund. It is hereby made the duty of the Comp-\\ntroller to see that a tax is levied and collected by the city suflicient to pay the\\ninterest semi-annually on all bonds issued. and to create a sinking fund sufficient\\nto pay the said bonds at maturity, and that said sinking fund is invested in good\\ninterest-bearing securities.,\\nA duty is here imposed upon the Comptroller to be performed for the benefit\\nof the bondholders; the certificate is an earnest to the purchaser that the Comp-\\ntroller has assumed its discharge.\\nThe duty placed by the law upon the Comptroller. it would le impossible for\\nhim to perform if the bonds were not valid. 1le could not \"see that a tax is levied\\nand collected by the city sufficient to pay interest and create a sinking fund\"\\nif no debt was created by the city council in attempting to issue bonds. By\\nregistering bonds that were invalid, he would place it beyond his power to comply\\nwith the balance of the law. That construction certainly will not be given the\\nlaw which would require of the Comptroller that which is impossible. In order\\nto prevent the occurrence of such contingency provision is made by the law that\\nat the time bonds are forwarded for registration. the Comptroller be furnished\\nwith a statement of the value of all taxable property and of the taxes levied. This\\nis certainly the purpose for which these statements are required. If this be not\\ntrue, what other purpose was in contemplation ? No provision is made for their\\npreservation or record; no provision is made to the effect that the city should\\nbe estopped from denying the facts which they purport to recite. They are evi-\\ndently for the use of the Comptroller alone. It may be that the Comptroller is\\nnot the tribunal to finally adjudicate the legality of city bonds.

It appears from the statements that the assessment\\nof the tax was properly made, and it is not shown but what the rolls were prop-\\nerly made out by the assessor and duly approved by the commissioners court as\\nrequired by law. In due time the taxes were paid. It seems that afterwards it\\nwas discovered by some one that the court only intended to assess the property\\nat three-fourths of its value. and at the regular term of the court in February,1893. an order was entered which purported to correct the assessment and reduce\\nit to three-fourths of its cash value, and ordered one-fourth of the county taxes\\nto be paild back to the bank.\\nThe question propounded by you is. whether. under the circumstances stated,\\nyou. as Comptroller of Public Accounts of this State, have the authority to re-\\nfund to the bank one-fourth of the State taxes so paid.\\nAmple rules are made for the protection of the citizens from excessive valua-\\ntion of property and the payment of excessive taxes thereon, but the remedy pro-\\nvided for in the statute must he pursued.\\nArticle 1517a, Sayles\\' Statutes. provides that the county commissioners courts\\nof the several counties of this State shall convene and sit as a board of equaliza-\\ntion on the second Monday in June. or as soon thereafter as practicable before\\nthe first day of July. to receive all tie assessment lists or books of the assessors\\nof their counties for their inspection. correction. equalization. and approval.\\nSection 2 of the same article provides that the board shall cause the assessor to\\nbring before them all the assessment books of the county for their inspection, to\\nsee that each and every person has rendered its property at its fair market value\\nas contemplated by law. Section 3 provides that the board of equalization shall\\nhave power to correct any errors in the assessment of property at any time before\\nthe tax is paid on said property.\\nWhen the taxes have been paid. it must be observed from tile reading of section\\n3 that the authority of the commissioners court sitting as a board of equalization\\nis exliausted. and they can not correct any errors in the assessment.

The position of Librarian is\\ntherefore evidently not considered or treated by the Legislature as an office, as\\nthe clerk of the Supreme Court is ex officio librarian.\\nThere is, however, one other question to be considered. Article XVI, sec-\\ntion 33. of the Constitution, provides that the accounting officers of this State\\nshall neither draw nor pay a warrant upon the treasurer in favor of any person\\nfor salary or compensation as agent, officer or appointee who holds at the same\\ntime any other position of honor, trust or profit under this State or the United\\nStates, except as prescribed in this chapter. Under the provisions of the Con-stitution first cited it will be seen that it was entirely competent for the Legis-lature to provide such compensation as it saw fit for the services of the clerk of\\nthe Supreme Court, and it also had authority to impose upon the incumbent of\\nthat office such additional duties as to the Legislature seemed proper, not incon-\\nsistent with his duties as clerk of the Supreme Court. The duties of the libra-\\nrian of the Supreme Court are not believed to be inconsistent with the duties of\\nthe clerk of the Supreme Court. and there seems to be no good reason why the\\nduties of librarian may not be imposed upon and discharged by the clerk of the\\nSupreme Court. The general appropriation bills for the years 1893 and 1894 ap-\\npropriated, under the head of \"\\' Supreme Court,\" for clerk\\'s salary, $2500 each\\nyear, and under the same head, \\'\" Salary of librarian at Austin, $720 each year.\"\\nIt must be presumed that the Legislature made this appropriation with a\\nknowledge of the law which constitutes the clerk of the Supreme Court librarian\\nfor said court. and places in his charge the safe keeping of the Supreme Court\\nlibrary. and with knowledge that the Legislature has heretofore annually appro-\\npriated various sums for the librarian, while the clerk of the Supreme Court\\nheld that position and received the pay. The power being by the Constitution\\nvested in the Legislature to fix the compensation of the clerk at such sum as it\\nsaw fit, his compensation was by law fixed at $2500 per annum, and in addition\\nto this the Legislature appropriated for his services in the care and control of\\nthe library the sum of $720 per annum. These items should be construed\\ntogether, and both be given effect if possible. It is plain that no other person\\nthan the clerk of the Supreme Court can draw the salary appropriated for a\\nlibrarian, because that officer is expressly constituted librarian by the law above\\ncited, and the Legislature had knowledge of this when both these items were\\npassed. Construing the two together, it is believed that they should be given\\nthe same effect as if the Legislature had appropriated $2500 per annum for the\\nclerk of the Supreme Court for his services as such, and $720 per annum for the\\nclerk of the Supreme Court for his ex officio services and attention to the Supreme\\nCourt library, or as if the Legislature had enacted a law fixing the salary of the\\nclerk and then providing additional compensation for his attention to the library,\\nor as if it had appropriated in one item the, total sum for services as both libra-\\nrian and clerk.\\nThe conclusion follows from what is above said that you are authorized to\\ndraw your warrant in favor of the said C. S. Morse for the salary appropriated\\nfor librarian. .\\nVery respectfully.\\n(Signed) FRANK ANDREWS,\\nOffice Assistant Attorney GeneraL\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', '54 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\nConfederate certificates.-Where the surveys for the holder of the Confederate certif-\\nicate and the school fund are not contiguous, the surveys are void.

Comptroller, Austin.\\nDEAR Sim-We have a communication from your department requesting the\\nopinion of this department upon a question propounded to you by R. E. L. Tom-\\nlinson, county clerk of Falls county, of date May 31. The questions propounded\\nare: \" Whether or not a party who pays an occupation tax to the tax collector\\nmust file the tax collector\\'s receipt with the county clerk. and have the clerk\\nissue an occupation license to the person filing the receipt? If the clerk must\\nissue the license and if he is entitled to the fee therefor; if so, what fee?\"\\nIn support of the proposition that this course should be pursued. article 945\\nof the Revised Statutes is cited. That article provides. in substance, that upon\\npresentation of receipts for occupation taxes, the county clerk shall issue a\\nlicense to the person paying the tax, authorizing him to pursue the occupation\\nnamed in the receipt during the time for which he has paid the tax. Prior to\\nthe act of 1870, upon the subject of occupation taxes and the manner of keeping\\naccounts with collectors, the law regulating the keeping of such accounts was\\ndifferent from that prescribed in the act of 1879 (General Laws. p. 143.) For-\\nmerly it was necessary for the county clerk to have the receipt presented to him\\nand to issue a license thereupon, and by this means keep a check upon the tax\\ncollector as to the amount of occupation taxes paid to that officer. .\\nThe act of 1879, however, provided a different method for keeping accounts\\nwith tax collectors, relative to occupation taxes. Section 9 of said act, which\\nwas also inserted by the codifier in the Revised Statutes, provides, in substance,\\nthat the Comptroller shall cause occupation tax receipts for each occupation, to\\nbe printed with his signature for all occupations payable to collectors, and for-\\nward the same to each collector. and charge him with the amounts represented\\nby the receipts sent him, and cause him to account therefor. It also requires\\nthe collector to keep stubs and to report to the Comptroller. It further contains\\nthe following provision: \"And no person shall pursue any occupation unless he\\nhas a receipt signed as herein provided by the Comptroller and collector.\" This\\nclearly means that every person having such receipt may pursue the occupation.\\nIt is believed that the Legislature intended to provide and did provide a differ-\\nent system of keeping accounts upon tax collecters, and intended, among other\\nthings. by such amendment to relieve the tax-payer of the unnecessary burden\\nof contributing to the county clerk a fee for the issuance of a license based upon\\na receipt, when the receipt would answer all practical purposes, and the Comp-\\ntroller would have a check upon the collector for all receipts issued. It is not\\nbelieved therefore that the law requires any person to take out a license from\\nthe county clerk to pursue an occupation after he has paid his occupation tax\\nand received his receipt from the tax collector. This view is strengthened by afurther act of the Legislature subsequent to the act of 1879, which expressly re-\\nquires a person pursuing the occupation of a---iquor dealer to pay an occupation\\ntax and to apply to the clerk for a license for theatursuit of such occupation.\\nWhere the statute does not otherwise require -tbe issuance of a license by the-\\nclerk, it is not believed that the person pursding the occupation is required to.\\ntake the same out.\\nVery respectfully,\\n(Signed) FRANK ANDREWS.\\nOffice Assistant Attorney GeneraL\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', '58 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\nPrinting Board.- When the Printing Board has refused to audit an account for pub-\\nlic printing, the Comptroller has no authority to draw a warrant upon the Treas-\\nurer.for payment of the same.

In whom is vested the authority to fill the vacancy in the officeof the clerk of the District and County Courts of Rains county, which has a\\npopulation of less than eight thousand inhabitants.\\nSection 9 of article V of the Constitution provides there shall be elected adistrict clerk for each county, and in case of vacancy the judge of the District\\nCourt shall-have power to appoint a clerk. By section 20 of article V of the\\nConstitution, it is provided that a county clerk shall be elected for each county,and that a vacancy in said office shall be filled by the Commissioners\\' Court,,Provided, that in counties having a population of less than eight thousand\\npersons there may be an election of a single clerk, who shall perform the duties\\n-of district and county clerks.\" The statutes (articles 1101, 1115, 1116a, 1143,\\nard 1159) contain similar provisions. In the county of Rains, at the general\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', 'REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 59\\nelection in 1892, one person was chosen to discharge the duties of these two offices,\\nand having died since his qualification, the question submitted is, By whom\\nshall the vacancy be filled ?\\nThe Constitution does not command the election of only one clerk In counties\\n\\'with a population of less than eight thousand. Mere authority for such action\\nis there given. This authority has been exercised by the Legislature, however,\\nand it has expressly enacted that in such counties \" only one clerk shall be\\nelected.\"\\nRevised Statutes, articles 1, 115, 1159.\\nAlthough both the Constitution and the statutes employ the terms \" election\"\\nand \" elected \" only in this connection, yet it appears clear that the statute espe-\\n-cially evidences a legislative intention that only one person shall discharge the\\nduties of district and county clerk in such counties. That the Legislature so\\nintended when there is an election is manifest, and no reason is perceived for a\\ndifferent rule where an appointment is made. The ground for such action is not\\nthat there is an election rather than an appointment. but that there are less than\\neight thousand people in the county, and until the law unmistakably rests the\\ndistinction upon the narrower reason of election instead of appointment, it can\\nnot logically be adopted.\\nBeing of the opinion therefore that only one person can be appointed to the\\nvacancy, the more diflictilt question arises, By whom shall he be designated ? It\\nis believed the appointment is confided by the Constitution to the Coimnissioners\\nCourt of Rains county. It is well known that the duties of county clerk are\\nmore important and affect more intimately a larger number of citizens of the\\ncounty than those of the district clerk. and it is to be presumed that in consoli-dating these ollices the piurpose was to merge the least into the more important.\\nand to lodge the appointive power in officials of the localities most concerned\\nand interested. It will he noted, also. that the authority of the (listriet judges to\\nfill vacancies in the oflice of district clerk is for temporary purposes. and the\\nperson appointed shall hold only -- until the oflice can be tilled by election.\" It\\nis true the Legislature has not provided for a special election in the former case.\\nbut 1no one will doubt its authority to do so under this constitutional provision.\\nSo far as the Constitution bears on the question, the authority given the district\\njudge to appoint was not intended as a permanent induction into office, though\\nthe statute seeks to make it such. The power given the Commissioners Court,\\non the contrary, extends to filling the vacancy for the balance of the constjtu-\\ntional term of two years, and this difference should certainly have some weight\\nin determining the question which authority should be superseded in case of ap-\\nparent conflict.\\nRlegardless of these minor considerations, the conclusion reached is, in my\\njudgment. the proper construction of the Constitution. Sections 9 and 20 of\\narticle V should be construed together, and thus considered it is believed that in\\nall counties with a population of more than eight thousand persons the district\\njudge is authorized to fill vacancies in the office of district clerk; and in coun-\\nties with a population of less than eight t housand persons, when only one per-\\nson discharges the duties of district and county clerk, the power to fill vacancies\\nis lodged in the Commissioners Courts. It will certainly not be contended that\\nthe Constitution confides the authority jointly to the district judge and Commis-\\nsioners Court. Besides the want of definite language indicating such purpose,\\nits manifest incongruity places it beyond serious contemplation. Section 9.\\nwhich alone confers power in this particular upon district judges, is silent both\\nas to the consolidation of the offices and, the person authorized to fill vacancies\\nin such cases. Such .is not the case, however, with section 20. Providing for\\nthe election of county clerks, it also prescribes that vacancies in those offices\\nshall be filled by the Commissioners Courts, and in the same sentence authorizes\\na consolidation of the offices. The proviso in this section which authorizes \\'the.\\nconsolidation has.immediate reference to the paragraph that a county clerk shall\\nbe elected for each county, and defining his duties. Generally -peaking, the of-\\nfice of a proviso is to impose a limitation or condition upon a preceding clause.\\nand in this case, read in the light of the context, the condition is only upon the\\nduties to be performed.', \"Section 9.\\nwhich alone confers power in this particular upon district judges, is silent both\\nas to the consolidation of the offices and, the person authorized to fill vacancies\\nin such cases.

(2) For expenses incurred\\nby the wife for the benefit of her separate property.\\nWallace v. Fenberg. 46 Texas. 35;\\nCox v. Miller. .54 Texas. 25;\\nBrown v. Chancellor. 1 Texas. 437;\\nGreen v. Ferguson, 62 Texas, 525.\\nUnder the facts stated it cannot be maintained that the obligation in quiestion\\nis for necessaries furnished the wife or her children. Then, is it for expenses\\nincurred for the benefit of her separate property?\\nThis, it seems, should be answered in the negative. \" If the wife joins her\\nhusband in the execution of a note for goods purchased for the wife to replenish\\na stock of goods that was the separate property of the wife, such purchase would\\nnot be for the benefit of the wife\\'s separate property in contemplation of the\\nstatute so as to make her liable on the note.\"\\nWallace v. Fenberg, 46 Texas, 35;\\nMiller v. Marx & Kempner. 65 Texas. 131.\\nThe proposed hond not being for necessaries furnished the wife and children,\\nnor for expenses incurred for the benefit of her separate property. we do not\\nthink she would be bound by it. A liquor dealer\\'s bond is a, statutory obligation,\\nand the law clearly contemplates that all parties to such bond should be liable\\nthereon; if, then, the principal in such an obligation would not be bound by it.\\nthe sureties would not be bound.\\nYou are therefore respectfully advised not to approve the proposed bond.\\nVery respectfully,\\n(Signed) MANN TRICE,Office Assistant Attorney General\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', 'REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 61\\n,Salary of Special Judge.- The account of L.

Mantooth & Townsend, of\\nLufkin, with whom you have. I presume from your letter, had correspondence,has also had consideration in the same connection.\\nThe questions presented may be succinctly stated:\\nMay lands classified as \" timbered\" be sold to persons other than actual set-\\ntlers?\\nMay more than one section of timbered land be sold to one purchaser?\\nSection 3 of the act of April 1, 1887, regarding the sale and lease of school and\\nother public lands (General Laws 1887, page 52). makes provision for the classi-\\nfication of lands belonging to.the funds mentioned, into \"agricultural, pasture,\\nand timber lands.\" Section 5. as amended in 1889 (General Laws 18,9. page 51),\\nprovides that when the classification has been made \" such land (that is the land\\nclassified) shall be subject to sale, but to actual settlers only \" in quantities be-\\ntween 80 and 640 acres. There is an exception to this limitation, to the effect\\nthat lands classified as \" purely pasture lands, and without permanent water\\nthereon,\" may be sold in quantities not exceeding four sections to the same set-\\ntler. It will be noted that the exception is not to land other than agricultural,but extends only to a portion of the lands classified as pasture lands. It will be\\nfurther noted that even the excepted lands must be sold to the actual settler.\\nThe proviso does not include -- timbered lands.\"\\nSection 7 fixes the prices of the several classes, placing lands \"valuable chiefly\\nfor the timber thereon \" at a minimum of five dollars.\\nSection 8. as amended in 1889, provides for sale to a former purchaser of an\\nagricultural or watered section of three ^ strictly pastoral\" sections. The pro-\\nvision is not extended to timbered lands.\\nSection 9 makes it the duty of the Commissioner to prescribe regulations\\nwhereby all purchasers shall be required to \" reside upon as a home the land pur-\\nchased by them for three consecutive years next succeeding the (late of their\\npurchase.\" This section also requires an affidavit that the purchaser desires the\\nland as a home and has settled thereon. It also prescribes the terms of pay-\\nmnent. and to the regulations then made there is a proviso to the effect that if\\nthe land applied for be -timbered land.\" the purchaser shall pay cash in full at\\nthe time of purchase.\\nSection 13, as amended in 1889. is with reference to timber and timbered land\\nexclusively. It gives the Commissioner authority to adopt such regulations re-\\ngarding the sale of timber on timbered land as may be deemed necessary; pre-\\nscribes minimum prices of timber per acre. and period within which purchaser\\nmust remove timber. In it there appears the following: \" and in no case * * *\\nshall less than one section of timbered land be sold to any one purchaser.\" The\\nsection is concluded with this proviso: \"All timbered lands from which the\\ntimber has been cut and taken off may be placed on the market and sold for\\nnot less than two dollars per acre, as other lands are sold under the provisions of\\nthis act.\"\\nAll sections of the act having a bearing upon the question submitted having\\nbeen reviewed, the law may be thus summarized: Lands having been classified\\nas agricultural, pasture. or timbered may be sold to actual settlers only in quan-\\ntities, of agricultural land of not less than 80 acres or more than 640 acres; of\\npasture lands, same with named exceptions: of timbered lands, not more nor less\\nthan one section.\\nThe conclusion reached therefore from a strict and literal construction of the\\nlaw, is that both interrogatories must be answered in the negative.\\nIt is suggested. however, that it was the intention of the Legislature to apply\\nthe provisions of the statute requiring settlement and continued occupancy, and\\nprescribing a limitation as to the amount thatmight be purchased, to agricultural\\nand pasture lands only.', 'All sections of the act having a bearing upon the question submitted having\\nbeen reviewed, the law may be thus summarized: Lands having been classified\\nas agricultural, pasture. or timbered may be sold to actual settlers only in quan-\\ntities, of agricultural land of not less than 80 acres or more than 640 acres; of\\npasture lands, same with named exceptions: of timbered lands, not more nor less\\nthan one section.\\nThe conclusion reached therefore from a strict and literal construction of the\\nlaw, is that both interrogatories must be answered in the negative.\\nIt is suggested. however, that it was the intention of the Legislature to apply\\nthe provisions of the statute requiring settlement and continued occupancy, and\\nprescribing a limitation as to the amount thatmight be purchased, to agricultural\\nand pasture lands only.\\nIt may be that a different rule might with propriety have been prescribed with\\nreference to lands valuable chiefly for the timber and with regard to agricultural\\nlands.\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', 'REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\nIt is doubtless also true that in most cases ownership of a single section of tim-\\nbered land will not justify the erection of saw-mills or the construction of ways.\\nof transportation of saw-logs. In fact, it may be that the terms of the law as\\nhere construed preclude the possibility, ordinarily, of sale of timbered land.\\nHowever this may be, the opinion is entertained that this is not a case in which\\nthe legislative intent may be looked to in order to fiestroy the plain terms of the\\nlegislative act. \" Courts are not at liberty to spequlate upon the intentions of\\nthe Legislature when the words are clear, and to coil strue an act upon their own\\nnotions of what ought to have been enacted.

I\\ndo not conceive it a case in which that which the Legislature has done maly be\\ndisregarded, in order that that which the Legislature might have intended to\\ndo may be so considered. I do not conceive it a case in which the certain im-\\nport of language may be ignored in order that a court, or an officer charged\\nwith interpretation, may enter the conjectural field of public policy.\\nIn an effort, however, to ascertain if possible that which the Legislature in-\\ntended should be done, the writer has examined carefully the journals of the\\nSenate and House of the Twentieth Legislature. by whom the law was passed,\\nand has attempted to become familiar with the circumstances attendant with the\\npassage of the bill and with the conditions that required its enactment.\\nIt appears that the original bill, or committee substitutetherefor, was a com-\\nplete and symmetrical measure. The general provisions of the bif were sub-\\njected to an exception with reference to timbered land, expressed lsection 13.\\nThis section placed the sale of timbered lands almost entirely within th~discre-\\ntion of the Commissioner. as it places now sale of timber within his diicretion.\\nAmendments were made that had the effect to entirely change the purport of the\\nsection.

A proposition was made that the Commissioner\\nof the Land )fice be given authority to sell timbered lands, under such rules as\\nhe might prescribe. This proposition was repudiated, but authority was given\\nto sell timber at discretion.\\nThere can be no inference that the Legislature intended to do that which it\\nrefused to do.

John D MrcCall, Comptroller.\\nDEAR Si-Your letter of May 5, regarding the registration of bonds by the\\ncity of Laredo, was duly received. A determination of the question submitted\\nhas required an exhaustive examination of all the laws which have been passed\\nby the Legislature with reference to the incorporation of cities and towns, and a\\ncareful study of the constitutional prov- ions affecting taxation. This fact will\\nexplain delay in the reply.\\nYou ask, substantially. whether cities of more than ten thousand inhabitants.\\nincorporated under the general laws. may issue bonds in excess of an amount\\nthat a tax of twenty-five cents on the $100 valuation will pay interest on and\\ncreate a necessary fund suflicient for their redemption at maturity.\\n\\'The first general incorporation.law passed in this State was approved J\\' a ry27: 1858. (Chapter 1, General Laws 1858, page 69.) This law drew a stine-\\ntion between villages and towns. and towns and cities. Its first section p vided\\nfor the incorporation of a village of more than three hundred inhabitants into a\\ntown. Its 36th section provided for the incorporation of a village or town con-\\ntaining fifteen hundred inhabitants into a city.\\nThe only provision with reference to taxation was the 18th section, which pro-\\nvided that the board of aldermen should have power to levy taxes, not to exceed\\nfifty cents on the one hundred dollars. This law remained unamended until 1873,when by an act approved May 26, 1873 (chapter 65. General Laws 1873, page 98),section 1 was so changed as to provide that where a village or town may contain\\na population of two hundred souls,\\'it might be incorporated as a town in the\\nmanner prescribed by the act.\\nOn March 15. 1875, an act was passed 1* regulating the incorporation of cities\\nof one thousand inhabitants or over.\" etc. This act was evidently intended to\\ncover the entire subject of municipal corporations. containing 158 sections, and\\ncovering substantially every matter that could properly be the subject of munici-\\npal regulation.\\nIt provided, however, no terms upon which a city or town not incorporated\\ncould be incorporated. The first section was to the effect, \"that any city con-\\ntaining one thousand inhabitants or over may accept the provisions of this act.\"\\nThe 157th section was, that \" the provisions of this act shall not apply to any\\ncity within the limits of this State until its acceptance by the city council of such\\ncity in accordance with the provisions of section 1 of this act.\" It had been the\\nuniversal custom before 1858 for cities and towns to incorporate by special act of\\nthe Legislature. After the act of 1858, incorporation under the general law was\\npermitted, but it appears that prior to the adoption of our present Constitution\\nthis was rarely done. Cities incorporated under that law and cities incorporated\\nunder special charters were permitted to adopt the law of 1875.\\nSection 81 of the act of 1875 provides \" that the city council shall have power\\nto annually levy and collect taxes, not exceeding 1 per cent; provided, that by\\nconsent of two-thirds of the voters of said city, the city council may levy and\\ncollect an additional tax, not exceeding I per cent.\"\\nThe authority to issue bonds is regulated by section 70, to the following effect:\\nThe city council shall have power \"to appropriate so much of the revenues of\\nthe city, emanating from whatever source, for the purpose of retiring and dis-\\ncharging the accrued indebtedness of the city. and for the purpose of improving\\nthe public markets and streets, erecting and conducting city hospitals, city halls.', 'Cities incorporated under that law and cities incorporated\\nunder special charters were permitted to adopt the law of 1875.\\nSection 81 of the act of 1875 provides \" that the city council shall have power\\nto annually levy and collect taxes, not exceeding 1 per cent; provided, that by\\nconsent of two-thirds of the voters of said city, the city council may levy and\\ncollect an additional tax, not exceeding I per cent.\"\\nThe authority to issue bonds is regulated by section 70, to the following effect:\\nThe city council shall have power \"to appropriate so much of the revenues of\\nthe city, emanating from whatever source, for the purpose of retiring and dis-\\ncharging the accrued indebtedness of the city. and for the purpose of improving\\nthe public markets and streets, erecting and conducting city hospitals, city halls.\\nwaterworks, and so forth, as they may from time to time deem expedient; and\\nin furtherance of these objects they shall have power to borrow money upon the\\ncredit of the city and issue coupon bonds of the city therefor, in such sum or\\nsums as they may deem expedient. to bear interest not exceeding 10 per cent per\\nannum, payable semi-annually at such places as may be fixed by city ordinance;\\nprovided, that the aggregate amount of bonds issued by the city council shall at\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', 'REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 65\\nno time exceed 6 per cent of the value of the property within said city subject to\\nad valorem tax.\"\\nSection 78 provided that said bonds should be signed by the mayor and coun-\\ntersigned by the secretary, payable at such places and at such times as may be\\nfixed by ordinance of the city council, not less than ten nor more than fifty\\nyears.\\n\" The act of 1875 was in force when our present Constitution took effect, and\\nremained in force thereafter, except in so far as it was repugnant to the Consti-\\ntution.\"\\nGould v.

If a less sum than\\none-fourth of 1 per cent should have been sufficient to pay the current expenses.\\na tax of one-half of the State tax could have been levied, including the amount\\nlevied to defray current expenses.\\nGould v.

The power of cities of less than ten thousand inhabitants being specific-\\nally set forth, and this power being limited by section 9 of article VI l of the\\nConstitution to exclude all other power to tax, section 81 of the act of 1875, so\\nfar as it applied to cities and towns of less than ten thousand inhabitants, was\\nrepealed and the section of the Constitution above quoted took its place.\\nThere was no necessary conflict between section 5, article XI of the Constitu-\\ntion and section 81 of the law, section 5 fixing the maximum of taxation and\\nsection 81 continuing to provide for the levy of \" such taxes as may be author-\\nized by law.\"', 'The power of cities of less than ten thousand inhabitants being specific-\\nally set forth, and this power being limited by section 9 of article VI l of the\\nConstitution to exclude all other power to tax, section 81 of the act of 1875, so\\nfar as it applied to cities and towns of less than ten thousand inhabitants, was\\nrepealed and the section of the Constitution above quoted took its place.\\nThere was no necessary conflict between section 5, article XI of the Constitu-\\ntion and section 81 of the law, section 5 fixing the maximum of taxation and\\nsection 81 continuing to provide for the levy of \" such taxes as may be author-\\nized by law.\"\\nThe power to issue bonds under section 76 was affected by the Constitution to\\nthis extent: First, no bonds could be issued without at the time of their issu-\\nA.

(2) For the erection of public buildings. Bonds for the last named pur-pose were limited to such an amount as a tax, not exceeding fifty cents on the\\none hundred dollars. would pay interest upon and create a sinking fund for ofat least 2 per cent. The bonds for indeotedness previously accrued were notlimited by any rate of taxation. Bonds for both these purposes must not aggre-\\ngate more than 6 per cent of the value of the property subject to tax. As none\\nof the purposes mentioned in section 76 could be the subject of bonded indebted-\\nness, except the two just mentioned, this rule would exclude bonds for the pur-\\npose of improving the public markets and streets, conducting city hospitals.erecting an(d conducting water works, and whatever improvements may have\\nbeen included under the very general expression -and so forth.\"\\nCities of ten thousand inhabitants continued, after the adoption of the Consti-\\ntutiion. to have the right to issue bonds for all purposes mentioned in section 76.\\nand no limitation was imposed upon this right except that at the time bonds were\\nissued provision must be made for their payment. an(d suclh provision could be\\nmfade under the Constitution and laws as they then existed to the extent men-\\ntioned in section 81.\\nEv the law of 1858. as amended in 1873. a distinctiou was made between towns\\nand villages containing two hundred inhabitants or more and towiis and cities\\ncontaining a population of fifteen hundred or more. The act of 1875 distin-\\nguished between towns an villages of two hundred anl less than one thousand\\ninhabitants anul cities with more than one thousand in habitants. By the (\\'on-\\nstitution of 1876, cities having more than ten thousand inhabitants were distin-\\nguished from cities and towns having a population of ten thousand inhabitants\\nor less.\\nIn Waxabachie v Brown. 67 Texas. 527. it is said. speaking of article Xl of\\ntile (Constitution : \"As to towns. there is no provision indicating any authority\\nto create a debt. nor any to issue bonds. except posSibly for the purpose of pay-\\ning any indebtedness which had accrued up to the time tile C onstitution went\\ninto etect.

This amendment did not\\naffect the taxing power of cities of more than ten thousand inhabitants. Cities\\nof this class, incorporated un der the generaL laws were not \" without the neces-\\nsary funds to defray the expense of erecting public buildings and other needed\\npermanent improvements for the reason that they were not authorized to levy\\nthe requisite tax;\" on the contrary. they had the authority to levy the requisite-\\ntax.

Citv of Denison is authority for the proposition that the\\nact of Marcli 23. 1887, which will hereafter be discussed, does not operate as a\\nrepeal of article 426. If this be true, then there can be no doubt of the correct-\\nness of the proposition just made.\\nWe are brought to the act of March 23. 1887. and to the construction of its\\neffect upon the authority of cities to levy taxes and issue bonds. This was en-\\ntitled \"An act to authorize cities and towns to levy and collect taxes for the con-\\nstruction or purchase of public.buildings. water works. sewers, improvements of\\nstreets. and other permanent improvements, and to issue bonds therefor, and to\\nrepeal all laws in conflict herewith.\" It provides for the levy and collection of\\na tax sufficient to meet the interest and sinking fund on all indebtedness incurred\\nprior to the adoption of the constitutional amendment of 1883; for the levy and\\ncollection of a tax of twenty-five cents for current expenses: for the levy and col-\\nlection of an additional tax of twenty-five cents for the construction or the pur-\\nchase of public buildings. water works. sewers. streets, or other permanent im-\\nprovements within the limits of such city or town; and it provides that for such\\nimprovements such city shall have the power to issue coupon bonds of the city\\ntherefor, but it is provided that the -aggregate amount of bonds issued for the\\npurpose named shall never reach an amount where the tax of one-fourth of one\\nper cent will not pay current interest and provide a sinking fund sufficient to pay\\nthe principal at maturity, and the amount of bonds legally issued under acts\\npassed prior to the adoption of the present Constitution shall not be computed in\\nestimating the amount of bonds which may be issued for the above named city\\nimprovements.\" Section 2 repeals all laws in conflict with the get.

Section 2 of the law repeals all\\nlaws in conflict with this act. This would perhaps result without such a repeal-ing clause. One law without a repealing clause supersedes a prior one to the.extent of a conflict. The question then arises as to whether or not a conflict ex-ists. Under the decisions cited. this permit of an additional tax does not in anymanner conflict with the tax which cities of ten thousand inhabitants or more\\nwere already permitted to levy. Why, then, should it be held that this bondissue. based upon this tax, dependent upon it. comes in conflict with the author-ity given cities of. more than ten thousand inhabitants to issue bonds dependent\\nand based upon an entirely different and independent levy? How, indeed,\\nleaving these views out of consideration, can it be said that the giving here of\\nthis authority to issue bonds providing for the improvements here mentioned,\\ncomes in conflict with authority previously given to issue bonds for some of the\\npurposes here named and for other purposes ? Could it not be as easily held a\\n.cumulative right. a cumulative authority ? Glancing over the laws which have\\nbeen mentioned, it will appear that from the adoption of the present Constitu-\\ntion up to the present time. every legislative act has been an extension of the\\nauthority of cities and towns with reference to taxation and the right to incur\\nindebtedness. A review of the same laws indicates that every extension has\\nbeen directed to cities and towns of less than ten thousand inhabitants, and that\\nup to the law of 1889, which will hereafter be reviewed. no amendment affecting\\ncities of more than ten thousand inhabitants was made to the law, unless by in-\\nference or implication.\\nArticle 426. as originally adopted, gave authority to levy a tax of twenty-five\\ncents on the oie hundred dollars in cities and towns of less than ten thousand in-\\nhabitants. When the Constitution was amended in 1883. this authority to tax\\nwas extended to conform to its provisions. This authority was again extended\\nin 1887, and there was attached to the power of taxation thus extended the right\\nto issue bonds. Article 426 and the constitutional provision upon which it was\\nbased, article V, section I1 of the Constitution, were independent primarily of\\nsection 8, article IX. of the Constitution, and the changes to that article fnd the\\nlegislation which has resulted from such changes have not affected them. Why\\nshould it be assumed that legislation evidently intended to enlarge the powers of\\none class of cities resulted by implication in the abridgement of the authority of\\nthe cities of another class? The plain intimation of the court in Muller v. City\\nof Denison, and the case of Texas Water and Gas Company v. Cleburne (21\\nSouthwestern Reporter, 391. 393). is to the effect that the legislation mentioned\\nhas affected cities of ten thousand inhabitants or less only. and has in no degree\\nabridged the powers or lessened the duties of cities of more than ten thousand\\ninhabitants.\\nAt no point in the history of legislation is article 420 of the Revised Statutes\\nin terms repealed.

TV. B. Hopkins. County Judge, Corpus Christi, Texas.\\nDEAR Sin-Your favor of June 4 has been duly considered. You state sub-\\nstantially, that during the years 1890-91 an epidemic of smallpox prevailed in\\nthe town of Corpus Christi. in the county of Nueces: that the city authorities\\ntook charge of affairs and spent about $3500 for the benefit and protection of\\nthe public health during said epidemic; that the commissioners court of Nueces\\ncounty as such never agreed with the city or undertook to bear any portion of\\nthe expense incurred by said city, though said court was in session several timesduring the prevalence of said epidemic; that at a meeting of said court subse-\\nquent to the incurring of said expense by said city a bill was presented by said\\ncity to said court for one-half the amount incurred by the city, and that at the-\\ntime the bill was presented the said court was composed of the same persons\\nthat were members thereof during the prevalence of the epidemic. and that by\\nunanimous vote of the court the account or bill was rejected; that at the May\\nterm. 1893, of said court said bill was again presented to said court and again.\\nrefused.\\nFrom your letter I deduce three propositions:\\nFirst. Is the county legally liable for any part of the expenses incurred by\\nthe city, and can the same be collected from the county by law?\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available .\", \"REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 71\\nSecond. If not-legally liable would it be competent for the Commissioners\\nCourt to appropriate any part of the county funds to the payment of any part of\\nthe expenses incurred by the city?\\nThird. Whether or not the action of the Commissioners Court in refusing to\\npay the claim was in the nature of a final judgment which settles the question or\\nmay it be opened and again repeatedly passed upon by the court from time to\\ntime?\\nIt seems that the first proposition must be answered in the negative. The city\\nauthorities had no power to contract a debt against the county without the con-\\nsent and authority of its Commissioners Court duly passed in an open session of\\nthat body. The said court never having agreed and undertaken to pay any part\\nof said expense. collection thereof cannot be. enforced by the city through the\\ncourts.\\nFears v. Nacogdoches county, 71 Texas, 337.\\nIn a former letter from this department, written before the claim was passed\\nupon by the court in the first instance, it was said in effect that as the county\\nhad authority to take proper action and make proper expenditure for the pro-\\ntection of the public health and co-operate with the city to accomplish this pur-\\npose it would be competent for the Commissioners Court to bear a pro rata partof the expense incurred by the city if said court saw proper to assume the obli-\\ngation, even after the expenditure was made. it being a purpose for which said\\ncourt might have contracted obligations if it had been shown to be necessary\\nfor the public health. No good reason now appears why this conclusion should\\nbe changed.\\nRev.

It is not believed that the action of said court was in\\nthe nature of a final judgment which renders the matter re- adjzidicata. but\\nrather that the action was of the same nature that would have been in the re-\\nfusal to pay any other claim against the county, or in refusing to do any other\\nact which it was competent for tbat court to do. While the auditing or refusal\\nto audit a claim may be considered quasi judicial, yet it is not believed that the\\nrefusal is a final judgment. as that term is judicially understood, and it would\\nb6 competent for the Commissioners Court to again consider the question at any\\nsubsequent term.\\nIn reply to your last question. as to whether this claim could be passed and\\nallowed by three commissioners, two of whom favor it, you are referred to\\narticle 1510. Revised Statutes, which provides that the fouI4 commissioners.\\ntogether with the county judge, shall compose the Commissioners' Court, and\\nthe county judge. when present, shall-be the presiding officer of said court.\\nUnder the law the county judge. as a member of said court, has the same power\\nand authority as any other member thereof, and may vote upon all questions\\nbefore the body for consideration. and in the case above stated it would be com-\\npetent for the county judge to cast his vote upon the proposition, and thus\\ncreate a tie and defeat the allowance of the claim. It is believed, therefore. that\\nas the Commissioners' Court would have had the authority to have made such an\\nexpenditure as was made by the city, that said court would have the authority\\nto assume an expenditure made by the city for this purpose, if in the exercise of\\na sound discretion it saw proper so to do, and this notwithstanding the court\\nmay have formerly refused to allow any part of the claim.\\n(Signed) Very respectfully, FRANK ANDREWS,\\nOffice Assistant Attorney General.\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available\", '72 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\nResidence on School Land.-A purchaser of school land under the act of 1887; tWho\\nprior to the expiration of the three years\\' occupancy required. has been elected\\n(rountU clerk of his county, and removes temporarily from his section, intending to\\nreturn to it upon the conclusion o~f his term of otflce, in the meantime improving it\\nand claiming it as his permanent home, has complied with all the requirements of\\nlaw and is entitled to a patent.\\nATTORNEY GENERAL\\'S OFFICE,\\nAUSTIN, June 30, 1893.\\nlon.

Texas.\\nDEAR SIR-The complaintof the citizens df Houston. submitted by vou, that\\nthe Houston and Texas Central Railroad Comphny has violated the laws of the\\nState in removing its land department from that city to the city of San Antonio.\\nhas been carefully considered. The material facts appear to be that this cum-\\npany is practically the successor of the Houston and Texas Central Railway\\nCompany. and now operates the road formerly owned by the latter company:\\nthat by its charter its principal office is fixed at the city of Houston, and that\\nrecently what is termed the -- land department\" of the company. consisting of\\nits land commissioner and clerks, and all books. documents, and records per-\\ntaining thereto, have been removed to San Antonio. and all the business of that\\ndepartment is now being transacted there. Since the complaint was made it is\\nunderstood the books. documents. and records which pertain to their right of\\nway. town lots, and depot and switching facilities, the use of which enters into\\nthe operation of the road. have been returned to Houston and placed in charge\\nof a competent official. leaving at San Antonio only such records as affect\\nthe lands claimed to have been granted the original company by the State. It\\nis insisted by the Land Commissioner that the present company is not the owner\\nand does not control any of the lands donated by the State, and consequently has\\nno \"land department \" in charge of such lands, but that the lands are owned\\nand controlled by a private individual. For several reasons the contention can-\\nnot be sustained, but in the view taken of the case it is unnecessary to enter\\ninto a discussion of this matter. Assuming that these lands are owned and con-\\ntrolled by the company now operating the road, the question presented is-\\nwhether our laws require railway companies to keep and maintain their land de-\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', '76 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\npartinent, to which are given the sale, lease and general custody of lands do-\\nnated by the State, and not used or available in the operation of their roads, at\\n.the place where the general offices are located.\\nThe Constitution (article X. section 3) requires railway companies to keep a\\npublic office In this State. The first Legislature which convened after the\\n-adoption of the Constitution required them to maintain a public office on the\\nline of their road in this State (Laws 1876, page 144), and this requirement was\\nretained (Revised Statutes. article 4115) in the Revision of 1879. There was no\\n-other legislation on this subject until the passage of the act of March 28, 1885\\n(General Laws 1885, p. 67), in which it was provided that railway companies\\nshould have and maintain a public office in the locality where their principal\\nbusiness is carried on in this State. on the line of their roads, for the transaction\\nof their business, \" where transfers of stock shall be made, where the auditor,treasurer. general traffic manager, and general superintendent of such roads, or\\nwhere an agent of such corporation, duly authorized tp adjust and settle all\\nclaims against such corporation for damages, shall have their respective offices,\\nand where shall be kept for the inspection of the stockholders.\" and such officers\\nor agents of the State as may be authorized to inspect them, the books of the\\ncompanies showing the capital stock. ownership thereof, amount paid, transfers\\nof stock. amounts of assets and liabilities and the names and places of residence\\nof their officers.\\nThe only other legislation applicable to the subject is the act approved March\\n27. 1889. By the first section of this act it is provided, among other things, that\\nevery railroad company chartered by this State or owning or operating any line\\nof railway within this Sttite shall keep and maintain permanently its general\\noilices within this State at the place named in its charter for the location of its\\n.general otlices. So much of section 2 as is pertinent to this inquiry is as follows:\\n** It shall be the duty of said railroad company to keep and maintain at the place\\nwithin this State where its general offices are located, the office of the president\\nor vice president. also the oflices of its secretary, treasurer, local treasurer,\\nauditor, gineral freight agent. traffic manager, general manager, general super-\\nintendent, general passenger and ticket agent. chief engineer, superintendent of\\nmotive power and machinery, master mechanic. master of transportation, train\\nmaster, stock and fuel agent, claim agent, and each and every one of its general\\noffices shall be kept and maintained; by whatever name it is known, and the per-\\nsons who perform the duties of said general offices. by whatever name known,\\nshall keep and maintain their offices at the place where the general offices of said\\nrailroad are required by law to be kept and maintained; and if the duties of any\\nof the above named offices are performed by any person. but his position is called\\nby a different name. it is hereby made the duty of said railroad company to have\\nand maintain said oflices at the place where its general Texas offices are kept and\\nmaintained as required by this act, * * * the object and meaning of this stat-\\nute being to require every railroad company owning or operating a line of rail-\\nway within this State, to keep and maintain its general offices within this State at\\nsuch places as required herein, and the name of the above as general offices shall\\nnot be understood to allow the railroad company to have any of the offices usually\\nknown as general oflices at any other place than the one it is required to keep its\\ngeneral offices at, and each and every railroad is hereby required to have and\\nmaintain its general oflices at the place named herein.\"\\nFrom this statement it is apparent that if the land department of this company\\nis one of its general offices within the meaning of these statutes, it must be kept\\nand maintained permanently at Houston. This is the sole question to be deter-\\nmined.', 'From this statement it is apparent that if the land department of this company\\nis one of its general offices within the meaning of these statutes, it must be kept\\nand maintained permanently at Houston. This is the sole question to be deter-\\nmined. If the act of 1885, in its application to this subject, may not be con-\\nsidered as superseded by the act of 1889. it is manifest that the land department\\nis not included in the offices there named, for the commissioner is neither\\nauditor, treasurer, general traffic manager, nor general superintendent, nor does\\nlie perform any of the duties usually discharged by such officers, nor is he an\\nagent of the company authorized to settle and adjust claims against it for dam-\\nages, nor the custodian of the books required to be kept by the act. It is equally\\nplain that it is not included in the act of 1889 eo nomine, and whether it is em-\\nbraced in certain general provisions of the act is the difficult question presented.\\nThe first section of the act requires, without naming them, that the \" general\\noffices\" of the company shall be kept and maintained at the place where its \"gen-\\neral offices are located. the office of the president or vice president,\\' etc., and by\\nthis the Legislature seems to have intended to enumerate the general officers who\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', 'REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 77\\nshall reside and keep their offices at that place, adding the general clause that\\n\" each and every one of its general offices shall be so kept and maintained. by\\nwhatever name it is known. and the persons who perform the duties of said gen-\\neral offices, by whatever name known, shall keep and maintain their offices at the-\\nplace where said general offices are required to be located and maintained, and\\nthe persons holding said general offices of a railroad shall reside at the place and\\nkeep and maintain their offices at the place where the general offices of said rail-\\nroad are required by law to be kept and maintained; and if the duties of any of\\nthe above named offices are performed by any person, but his position is called\\nbya different name. it is hereby made the duty of said railroad company to have\\nand maintain said offices at the place where its general Texas offices are kept and\\nmaintained as required by this act.\" an(d that \\' the name of the above as general\\noffices shall not be understood to allow the railroad company to have any of the\\noffices usually -known as general offices at any other place.\" The first of these\\ngeneral provisions refers in terms to the preceding enumeration of officers. and\\nconsequently is not more comprehensive; and. regarding the purpose of the act,\\nthe use of the words \" usually known as general offices\" in the second section\\nwas not intended to do more than supply the possible omission of offices con-\\nnected with the operation of the road as a railway and of a kindred nature to\\nthose previously named. The purpose of the act is to deal only with officers of\\nthe company whose duties pertain to its business as a common carrier of freight\\nand passengers.\\nThis construction accords with the history and policy of this legislation.\\nPrior to the act of 1885 many of the railways of the State were controlled by an\\nillegal combination, ind such of their general offices as are named in said act\\nwere kept and maintined in other States. All business in charge of the general\\nsuperintendents, general managers. treasurers. auditors. freight and passenger\\nagents. and claim agents were transacted there. All complaints of passengers\\nand shippers were required to wait upon the tedious and unsatisfactory process\\nof adjustment under such a system. Unquestionably the Constitution required\\nthe maintenance of a public oflice in the State. but legislation was necessary to\\nenumerate the several offices and provide adequate penalties. and consequently\\nthis act was passed. The policy of this and subsequent legislation rests largely\\nin the convenience of the people. and is indicative of its-purpose. The officials\\nof the companies charged with their management, brought together on their\\nlines. can more rapidly and satisfactorily discharg? their duties: obviously more\\npeople living on the line of roads have business with the companies as common\\ncarriers than elsewhere. and public interests are subserved by the concentration\\nand maintaining of such offices on the line of road. These considerations, how-\\never, do not affect the land department. for it can neither be said that the com-\\nmissioner can conduct the business more advantageously at some point on the\\nroad. nor that purchasers and lessees will be more numerous along the line of\\nrailway.\\nThe history of the act of 1889 is particularly significant of its bearing upon\\nthis question. The Texas and Pacific Railway Company contracted to locate and\\nmaintain permanently its general offices. roundhouses and machine shops at\\nMarshall, and did locate them there. About 1884 the land department of\\nthat company, which had been maintained at Marshall, was removed to Dallas:\\nand afterwards the company removed its general otlices to Dallas. It is well\\nknown that the law of 1889. the authors of which represented Marshall in the\\nIhegislature. was intended to have particular application to that case. yet while\\nit was understood that the land department had been removed, and while the\\nrepresentatives of that city exercised the precaution to enumerate all general\\noflices connected with the operation of the road whose designation was known.\\nand by general provision to guard against changes of destination and every\\ncharacter of evasion, this department was not named. In view of these facts and\\nthe apparent ambiguity of the law, this ommission must be given controlling\\nweight.\\nContrary to my first impression. I am of the opinion that the land department\\nof this company, as now conducted at San Antonio, is not one of the general\\noffices within the meaning of the statutes.\\nVery truly yours, -\\n(Signed) C.A.

G, 7. and S of the act -of July 8. 1879, and does not amend the sections\\nof said last act relative to forfeiture and transfer of the lands.\\nSection 15 of the act of 1879 provides that if any purchaser desires to sell said\\nland after he has made his first payment on the same, be may do so; but in that\\nevent his vendee shall file in the General Land Officeta properly authenticated\\ntransfer from said purchaser. and said vendee shall be liable to the obligations\\nand penalties imposed upon said original purchaser. It may be that the declara-\\ntion in this section that the vendee shall be liable to the obligations and penal-\\nties imposed upon said original purchaser is tantamount to a declaration that\\nwhen the obligations and liabilities are so assumed bv the subsequent vendee.\\nthe original purchaser shall be released from all further liability. If the original\\npurchaser had sold the land and the transfer. properly authenticated. was filed\\nin the General Land YOflice. and lie thereby became released from further lia-\\nbility. and parted with his interest in the land. he would neither be a necessary\\nnor a proper party to the suit. B ut. however this may be. the subsequent ven-\\ndee of the original purchaser who held the transfer from the original purchaser\\nwould not only be a proper but a necessary party to the suit to obtain a valid\\nj*ugment for the property sued for. and without such vendee being made a party\\nto the suit, his interest would not be concluded, because the lien of the State on\\nthe land is not expressly reserved. but arises by implication only.

This\\ncan not be doubted. The act, it is true, provides that the purchase shall be made\\nby the Penitentiary Board. but, for obvious reasons, the purchase is for the\\nState, and provision is made for the payment of the debt thus created with the\\nreveniue of the State. The inhibitioin is against the creation of a debt by or on\\nbehalf of the State. The school fund is devoted exclusively to the support and\\nmaintenance of the public free schools. It can not be lawfully used for any other\\npurpose, though it may be invested in the securities named or provided for in\\nthe Constitution.\\nArticle VII, section 4.\\nIn this case the State offers and is authorized to borrow three hundred thous-\\nand dollars of the fund, and the question is, is it such a debt as may be created.\\nThe power of the State to create a debt is by section 49 of article III of the Con-\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available\", 'REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 81\\nstitution limited to the following language: \"No debt shall be created by or on\\nbehalf of the State, except to supply casual deficiencies of revenue, repel inva-sion, suppress insurrection. defend the State in war. or pay existing debt; and\\nthe debt created to supply defliencieg in the revenue, shall never exceed in the\\naggregate at any one time $200,000.\"\\nIf, then, the debt proposed by said act is permissible under the above clause\\nof the Constitution, the act is valid. We do not think, however, that the pur-\\nchase of agricultural and farming lands for the purpose of utilizing convict-\\nlabor thereon can be shid to come within the letter, spirit. or meaning of either-,\\nclass of cases wherein it is permissible for the State to pledge its credit underi\\nthe above quoted provision of the Constitution. There can, of course. be no\\npretense that the debt is to he created to repel invasion, suppress insurrection\\nor defend the State in war. It is not proposed to create it to pay existing debt.\\nThere is no casual deficiency in the revenue. and the act exceeds the constitu-\\ntional limit of such debt a hundred thousand dollars. The act is an undisguised\\nproposition to create a debt. not for any of the purposes named in the Constitu-\\ntion, but to purchase land on which to employ convict labor. The provision of\\nthe Constitution is clear. plain and explicit, and limits the power of the Leg-\\nislature to create any debt except for \\'the purposes therein enumerated. andwhatever reason may exist for creating a debt for any other purpose, we can-\\nnot disregard the plain provisions of the Constitution. The Constitution can-\\nnot be changed by the varying suggestions of public policy in the management\\nof State institutions, but the provisions therein contained having been inserted\\nby the people, must remain the inflexible law until altered by them.\\nYou are therefore respectfully advised that the act is unconstitutional and void.\\nVery respectfullv,\\n(Signed) MANN TRICE,\\nOffice Assistant Attorney General.\\nCommissions of Tax Assessor.-A. tax assesssor. for assessing taxes in special\\nschool districts, is entitled to receive a commission of one per centum upon the\\namount of the tax assessed against the district, and is not entitled to a commission\\nupon the amount of the property assessed.\\nATTORNEY GENERAL\"S OFFICE,\\nAUSTIN, October.17. 1893.\\n1?.

You state that you and the Commis-\\nsioners Court differ as to the compensation to be paid you for assessing the taxes\\nin special school districts. you contending that you are entitled to one per\\ncentum upon the value of the property assessed. and the C6mmissioners Court\\ncontending that you are only entitled to one per centum upon the amount of the\\ntax assessed against the property.\\nYour attention is called to section 48 of the act of 1893, regulating the public\\nfree schools of this State. The latter clause of said section provides that the\\ntax assessor shall receive a commission of one per centumn for assessing such tax,\\nand the tax collector a commission of one per centum for collecting the same.\\nYou will readily see that if the one per centumn to be paid the assessor is to be\\none per centum upon the value of the property assessed. you will be entitled to\\nreceive one dollar upon every hundred dollars worth of property situated in the\\ndistrict, whereas the law only authorizes a school district to levy a tax of twenty\\ncents on the one hundred dollars. You would thus be receiving five times as\\nmuch as the highest limit that could be levied on the district, and the district\\nwould of course come out very largely in debt. It is clear that the Legislature\\nin the language used intended that you should receive only one per centum upon\\nthe amount of the tax assessed against the district. To illustrate, if the district\\nhas fifty thousand dollars in taxable property and a tax of twenty cents is levied\\non each one hundred dollars, one thousand dollars would be the amount of the\\ntax assessed against the property and you would be entitled to receive one per\\ncent upon the thousand dollars assessed for the district.

I am informed by your department that the uniform con-\\nstruction placed upon this law by your office for the past ten years has been that\\nno fees in such cases have been allowed. )uring this time the Legislature has\\nfrequently met. and. in its investigation of fees. etc., as appertaining to your\\ndepartment. .has had actual knowledge. through its committees,. of such con-\\nstruction. and the entire body has at least had constructive knowledge thereof,\\nand no new law has been enacted upon the subject. This strengthens the con-\\nstruction that a -fdlony case.\" within the meaning of said law. means an actual\\ntrial upon the merits of the case. and that the witnesses are attached and are\\nrecognized for that purpose.\\nWe, therefore, conclude that the law referred to does not provide fees for wit-\\nnesses in an examining trial or habeas corpus for the purpose of raising a de-\\nfendant\\'s bond.\\nThe accounts are herewith returned you.\\nVery respectfully,\\nFRANK ANDREWS.\\n(Signed) Office Assistant Attorney General.\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', 'REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 83\\nCounty Commissioner.-A county commissioner must be a resident of the precinct\\nwhich he represents, and a failure to reside in said precinct vacates the office.\\nATTORNEY GENERAL\\'S OFFICE.\\nAUSTIN, October 28. 1893.\\nlon.

You state substantially\\nthat you are a married man. only twenty years old, and that your disabilities as\\na minor have been removed, and you inquire whether or not you are eligible\\nunder the laws of this State to bold the office of county clerk.\\nArticle 3361a, Savles\\' Civil Statutes. provides that after the removal of the\\ndisabilities of a minor the said minor shall be deemed and held for all legal pur-\\nposes of full age, and shall be held responsible and shall have all the privileges\\nand advantages as if he were of full age. saving only that he shall not vote until\\nhe arrives at the fulliage of twenty-one years. The statutes of this State do not\\nprescribe any particular age \\'for the office of county clerk. In this State that\\nparticular question has not been passed upon. In the 80th Texas. page 428,\\nSteusoff v. State, the question there presented was whether or not one not a\\nqualified voter for want of residence was eligible to the office of tax assessor.The court held that the person was eligible to the office, though not entitled to\\nvote. and in discussing the general rules of qualifications for office holding. Jus-\\ntice Gaines lays down the following: \" In Barker v. People, 3 Cowan, 703, the\\nChancellor who delivered the opinion of the court said: -Eligibility to office is\\nnot declared as a right by principle by any express terms of the Constitution,\\nbut it rests as a just deduction from the express powers and provisions of the\\nsystem. The basis of the principle is the absolute liberty of the electors and the\\nappointing authorities to choose and appoint any person who is not made ineli-\\ngible by the Constitution. Eligibility to office belongs, therefore. not exclu-sively or specially to electors enjoying the right of suffrage. It bdlongs equally\\nto all persons whomsoever not excluded by the Constitution.\\' When a Con-\\nstitution has been framed which contains no provision defining in terms who\\nshall be eligible to office, there is strength in the argument that the intention\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', '84 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\nwas to confide the election to the untrammeled will of the electors. Experience\\nteaches us that in popular elections those only are chosen who are in sympathy\\nwith the people both in thought and aspirations,,and that no law is needed to\\'\\nsecure the selection of those only who reside in the county or district in which\\ntheir functions are to be performed.\"\\nThis language by our Supreme Court seems to recognize the right of the elec-\\ntive or appointive power, in the absence of constitutional or legal restrictions,\\nto select such persons to fill the office as to them seem meet and proper, and in\\nview of the declarations in article 3361a above quoted. and of this declaration\\nby our Supreme Court. it is believed that you are eligible to the office of county\\nclerk.\\nVery respectfully,\\n(Signed) FRANK ANDREWS,\\nOffice Assistant Attorney General.\\nIssuance of bonds by Commissioners Court.-County Commissioners Court has no-\\nauthority to issue bonds for the purpose of building roads only.\\nATTORNEY GENERAL\\'S OFFICE.\\nAUSTIN, December 2. 1893.\\nCol.

In the opinion of this department such authority is not con-\\nferred upon the Commissioners Court. Chapter 84 of the Acts of 1893 provides\\nthat the counties of this State shall have authority to issue bonds \\' for pur-\\nchasing or constructing bridges for public purposes within the county or across\\na stream that constitutes a boundary line of a county.\" This, in our judgment,\\nwould not authorize the issuance of bonds to build roads permanent in their\\ncharacter, and such small bridges and culverts as might be necessary in building\\nthe roads, the primary object of the bonds being to acquire money with which\\nto build the road.

You stati\\nthat on December 21 an election was held In Karnes county for the removal o\\nthe county seat; that charges of fraud and illegal voting have been made,,aut\\nthat while the returns from one voting precinct show that 190 votes were cast, i\\nhas been asserted by those intereqted that only 109 votes were cast in fact at sall\\nvoting box, and that one of the managers of the election at said box asserted the\\nonly 109 votes were in fact cast.

Sayles\\' Statutes,.provides for the manner of contesting such elec-\\ntions. but this article was declared unconstitutional by our Supreme Court in\\nHarrell v. Lynch.. 65 Texas, 146. It is therefore without force except in so faras it may aid in the construction of the statute bearing upon the question at bar,\\nas showing the legislative intent at the time of the passage of the act relative to\\nremoving county seats in 1879.\\nArticle 700. supra, also provides that such elections shall be conducted as near\\n-as may be as elections for county officers. The provision reasonably includes the\\nmanner of making returns and counting the same as well as other duties imposed\\nupon officers holding an election for county officers..\\nNo case is found or shown wherein our Supreme Court has passed upon the\\n-question presented. In Worsham v. Richards, 46 Texas, 441, it wasiheld by our\\nSupreme Court that the duty of ascertaining whether or not a place was within\\nfive miles of the geographical center of a county should be performed by the\\nCounty Court, and that in the event of fraudulent votes the matter could be\\nproperly contested before that court. notwithstanding no provision -for contest\\nwvas in the law as It then existed. Since that decision the law has been in many\\nmaterial respects amended, with a legislative view, no doubt, to meet the objec-\\ntions to the old law pointed out in that opinion. It could scarcely be considered\\nas an authority even by analogy under the present law. the County Court as then\\nconstituted being entirely different from our present County Courts, and also\\nour entire election system having been changed. The law. as it now is, does not\\n-confer upon the county judge any authority or jurisdiction to sit in a contest of\\nsuch an election. Nor is it believed that such authority can reasonably be in-\\nferred from that given, for that, the legislative mind is clearly expressed that\\nthe contest shall be elsewhere held. Article 702. supra.\\nThis is further made to appear by the amendment to article V. section 8, of\\nthe Constitution, adopted September 22, 1891. Under said section, prior to\\namendment, there was no jurisdiction conferred upon the District Court of such\\ncontested elections. The amendment expressly confers upon the District Court\\nthe original jurisdiction -of contested elections.\" It is believed. therefore, that\\nthe county judge has no jurisdiction in any capacity of a contest of such elec-\\ntion, and can. therefore. perform only the mipisterial duties imposed upon him\\nby statute as the returning officer of such election, the election in this case hav-\\ning been ordered by that officer. The rule as to a returning officer\\'s duty is thus\\nstated: \" They must receive and count the votes as shown by the returns, and\\nthey can not go behind the returns for any parpose.\" McCrary on Elections, sec-\\ntion 82.\\nThe same author, section 84. says: \" The doctrine that canvassing boards and\\nreturn judges are ministerial officers, possessing no discretionary or judicial\\npower, is settled in nearly or quite all theStates.\" Thesepropositionshavemany\\ncases cited under them which fully support the text.\\n\"\"The duties of county., district and State canvassers are generally ministerial.\\nThey are to determine the result shown by the returns, which are by law made\\nthe basis of their action.

The\\ncompany is not organized for gain or profit, but to subserve a public purpose\\nwithout charge or remuneration. In view of these and the considerations already\\nadverted to, the purpose of the corporation Is charitable; and that it is purely\\npublic, benefiting alike all the residents of the City of Austin as members of the\\ncorimunity, and excluding all ideas of private gain or profit, cannot admit of\\nquestion.\\nGerke v.

If it be true that the salaries are thus fixed, the conclusion reached\\nnecessarily follows. But such is not believed to be the case. On September 30.\\n1893, you were advised in answer to an inquiry that the \" Legislature appropri-\\nated out of the general revenue the specific sum named for the maintenance and\\nsupport of the Medical Branch. and in addition appropriated the tuition fees the\\nstudents of said University might pay in.\" A careful re-examination of the\\nquestion convinces us that this is the proper construction of the act. for the\\nreasons given. The course proposed by the Board of Regents accords with this_\\nconstruction. If it be held that the specification of it in the act is tantamount\\nto a limitation upon the amount the Regents are authorized to pay for the pur-\\nposes respectively named, it will overthrow this interpretation, and lead logically\\nto the conclusion that the sum to be used for the support and maintenance of the\\nMedical Branch of the University is limited to the amount appropriated out of\\nthe general revenue. Obviously this would destroy that portion of the act ap-\\npropriating the matriculation fees of students supplementary to that taken from\\nthe general revenue. It is a familiar rule that that construction should if pos-\\nsible be adopted which will give effect to every provision of a law. It seems to\\nbe admitted that this is the true meaning of the act with reference to all items\\nexcept for the salaries of professors, demonstrators-of aniatomy and physiology,\\nprovost and janitor. it being insisted that no greater amount lnay be paid for\\nthe salaries of professors than g21.800, and that the salaries of the others named\\nare limited to the amounts specified. But there is nothing in the act which\\nshows an intention to discriminate in these cases by fixing the salaries and leav-\\ning without limit amounts used for laboratories. school of pharmacy, etc., and\\nunless such intention appears. such item must be held to be governed by the gen-\\neral.object of the law. Considered in connection with the authority expressly\\nconferred upon the Board of Regents to fix the salaries of professors and other\\nofficers (2 Sayles\\' Statutes, article 3681b. section 8), the Legislature by the act in\\nquestion appropriated for the support and -maintenance of the Medical Branch\\nof the University (1) the matriculation fees of students, and (2) an aggregate\\nsum out of the general revenue, the latter of which must be limited andsusedfor\\nthe purpose sspecifically pointed out in the act. The authority being expressly\\ngiven the Board of Regents by a general law to fix the salaries of professors and\\nother officers of the University, it would not be held to be revoked by an. appro-\\npriation bill unless such purpose unmistakably appears.\\nVery respectfully,\\n(Signed) C. 4.

This act was amended March 11. 1881, but in a particu-\\nlar not pertinent to your inquiry. By the act approved January 22, 1883, it isprovided that all of the public lands heretofore authorized to be sold under thetwo acts above referred to are withdrawn from sale; provided. that nothing con-\\ntained therein shall be construed to return said land to the mass of the public\\ndomain, but the same shall be considered to be reserved for the purposes for\\nwhich said land was originally set apart and designated by said act until theLegislature shall otherwise provide. It would seem from this to be clear that\\nthe public lands situated within the reservation, notwithstanding the fact that\\nthey have been withdrawn from sale, are yet reserved and set apart for the pur-\\nposes named in the act of July 14. 1879. and the amendment referred to. The\\nact of March 29,1889. is entitled \"An act to promote the development of the min-\\ning resources of Texas,\" and has for its purpose the \" sale of all the public school,\\nuniversity, asylum. an d public lands containing valuable mineral deposits.\"\\nSection 10 of the act provides that -any person or association of persons. quali-\\nfled as provided by section 1 of this act. shall have the right to locate and obtain\\na patent on any quantity of these lands containing deposits of coal, iron ore,\\nkaolin. marble, etc.\" The act approved May 2,1893. is an amendment to section\\n10 of the act of March 23, 1889, above referred to. and provides \"that any person\\nshall have the right to purchase and obtain patent, by compliance with this act,\\non any public school. university, asylum, and public lands containing valuable\\ndeposits of kaolin. etc.\" It is understood from your letter that the attempt is to\\npurchase, not public school, university or asylum. but public lands. The term\"public lands\" is no doubt used synonymously witD \"public domain\" which\\nhas been defined by our Supreme Court to be \"unappropriated public domain\"\\n(Day Co. v.

In your first question you state\\nsubstantially, that on the 12th day of February., at the regular term of the Com-\\nmissioners Court, the court duly created the office of county superintendent of\\npublic instruction for the county of Tyler. In pursuance of said act creating\\nsaid office, the court duly appointed a person properly qualified to the office thus\\ncreated; that such person did every act on his part necessary to qualify to said\\noffice, and tendered his bond to the Commissioners Court for approval, and that\\nthe court was thorougly satisfied with the validity of the bond so presented. On\\nthe 17th day of February, after the presentation of the bond, and after the oath\\nof office had been taken by the appointee. the court passed an order to abolish\\nsaid office. About these facts there is no controversy. The question presented\\nis, whetber or not the action taken by the Commissioners Court in the first in-\\nstance, and after the attempted qualification of the appointee. the court had\\nauthority to abolish the office to take effect immediately, or whether or not such\\naction could only take effect after the next election, that being the term for\\nwhich the appointee would be entitled to hold his office.\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available\", \"94 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\nSection 37 of the act of 1893, regulating the public free schools of this State,\\nprovides for the office of county superintendent of public Instruction. and au-thorizes the County Commissioners Court. when in their judgment they deem it\\nadvisable, to provide for the election of county superintendent of public instruc-\\ntion at each general election, and when the offlee is so created it is the duty ofthe court to appoint a superintendent. who shall perform the duties of such officeuntil a county superintendent shall have been elected as subsequently provided\\nin the act and shall have qualified. Subdivision (i) of said section provides that\\nthe County Commissioners Court shall have power to abolish the office of county\\nsuperintendent of public instruction by an order entered on the minutes of theircourt at a regular term thereof. Subdivision (j) of the same section provides\\nthat when the office is abolished the county superintendent shall serve out the\\nterm for which he was elected. There is perhaps no difference in the status of\\nan officer legally appointed by the Commissioners Court having proper authority\\nto make such appointment and one duly elected by the people at a general elec-\\ntion. It is also well known as a part of the history of this law that this limita-\\ntion upon the authority of the Commissioners Court to abolish the office was to\\nprevent the Commissioners Court from legislating a person out of office who\\nwas objectionable to that body. either personally or otherwise, and it is believed\\nthat the appointment would give the person the same status in the office that an elec-\\ntion would have given him. The question then arises as to whether or not the per-\\nson had been duly appointed to the office; that is. whether his appointment was\\ncomplete or whether it was subject to revocation. The authorities upon this\\npoint are perhaps not in entire accord. The weight of authority. however.\\nseems to be to the effect that where an officer has been appointed by a body con-\\npetent to make the appointment. and has done and stands ready to do all acts re-\\nquired of him in qualifying for the office, the appointment thus made is not\\nsubject to revocation. but is complete in so far as the appointing power is con-\\ncerned.\\nIn the case of State v. Barber., 58 Conn., 76. it was held, that where a joint con-\\nvention of the city council met for the purpose of making an appointment for\\nprosecuting attorney, and a ballot was properly taken, and one person received\\na majority of all the votes cast. and the result was announced by the presiding\\nofficer, and subsequently a motion was made to take another ballot, and some\\nother person was by motion declared elected, it was held that the appointment of\\nthe first person was complete and that he was entitled to the office and entitled to\\nqualify. See also Mechem on Public Officers. section 114, and authorities there\\ncited; Throop on Public Officers, sections 88 and 89. and authorities there cited.\\nFrom these we conclude that the weight of authority is to the effect that the\\nperson having been duly appointed by the Commissioners Court had a definite\\nand well defined term of ollice to fill, extending from the date of his appoint-\\nmnent until the election and qualification of his successor, and that under the\\nstatute he cannot be deprived of the office under the appointment so made until\\nthe expiration of his term. This question, however, has never been passed\\nupon. so far as I can ascertain, in this State, and if the Commissioners Court\\ncontinue to refuse to approve the bond, the appointee would of course have his\\nremedy at law. The question would by that means be definitly and positively\\nsettled.\\nVery respectfully.\\n(Signed) FRANK AN DREWS.\\nOffice Assistant Attorney General.\\nFranchise Tax.-I. 0. 0.

F.. of the State of Texas is exempt from the franchise tax imposed by chapter\\n102 of the acts of the Twenty-third Legislature, I beg to say that section 3 of\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available\", 'REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 95\\n-said act provides that each and every private domestic corporation. heretofore\\nchartered, or that may hereafter be chartered under the laws of this State, and\\neach and every foreign corporation that has received. or may hereafter receive.\\na permit to do business under the laws of this State, shall pay the Secretary of\\nState an annual franchise tax of ten dollars. Section 7 of the act expressly, ex-\\nempts from the payment of the tax. -corporations organized for the purpose\\nof religious worship. or for holding places of burial not for private profit, or\\nfor school purposes. or for purely public charity.\"\\nThe general objects and purposes of the Grand Lodge of I. 0. 0. F.. as ex-\\npressed in its charter, are \"for better providing the means nd associated effort\\nfor visiting the sick. reli g the distressed. burying the dead and educatingthe orphans. and for the better diffusion of the principles of benevolence and\\ncharity.\" Section 10 of the charter provides that it shall have power \"to estab-\\nlish, endow, superintend and control one or more manual labor. mechanical.\\nagricultural, scientific and classical colleges and univei-s.ities; also to insti-\\ntute. regulate and maintain houses for the widows and orphans of deceased Odd\\nFellows.\\nIt is apparent from the above that the general objects of the order are two-\\nfold. viz., charitable and edlucational. In so far as the establishment of schools\\nis concerned. there can be no question but that the same would be exempt under\\nthe very terms of section 7; but as to whether the practice-of charity and benev-\\nolence. visiting the sick and distressed. caring for. educating, and maintaining the\\nwidows and orphans of deceased Odd Fellows come within the meaning of the\\nterm \" purely public charity \" is a question not so. easy of solution. That the\\npractice of these commendable virtues is charitable there can be no question,but inasmuch as a portion of the dispensation of charity by the order is limited\\nto members of the ordea it is seriously contended that this eliminates the purely\\npublic features of the charity. and renders the institution subject to the payment\\nof the tax. This question has never been decided by the courts of this State, but\\nit has frequently been presented to and decided by the courts of other States, and\\nthe opinions widely differ; some holding that inasmuch as the dispensations of\\ncharity.by such orders are limited to the members of the orders and not open to\\nthe public, such institutions are not for \" purely public charity,\" while other\\ncourts hold that it is not necessary for the institutions to be open to the indeft-\\nnite public, but that if the institution is administered for charity, and not for\\nprivate profit or gain, this gives it the character of a \" purely publifc charity.\"\\nOne of the leading cases holding that such an institution is not for \"purely\\npublic charity\" is the case of Bangor v. Masonic Lodge. 73 Maine. It was there\\nheld that as the lodge was for the mutual benefit and protection, and the end to\\nbe attained private and personal. and its benefits confined to privileged persons\\nand not open to an indefinite public. it could not be considered for \" purely pub-\\nlic charity.\" This case is supported by a strong array of authorities on the same\\nline.\\nFrom the language used by the courts in deciding these cases. we infer that the\\ncharters of the institutions limited the right to dispense charity to members of\\nthe order. It will be noted. however, that the charter of the order under con-\\nsideration does not limit the dispensation of charity to a partictilar class, except\\nin a single case-that is. widows\\' and orphans\\' homes. which are limited to the\\nwidows and orphans of deceased Odd Fellows. In no other instance is its char-\\nity limited to any specified class of persons.\\nBut suppose the right to dispense charity be limited to members of the order\\nexclusively: even then there is a strong array of authorities which hold that the\\ninstitution would be for -purely public charity\\' within the meaning of the\\nstatute exempting such institutions from taxation. For instance, in a case where\\na testatrix in her will provided for the establishment of an orphan asylum.', 'we infer that the\\ncharters of the institutions limited the right to dispense charity to members of\\nthe order.

The judge of the trial\\ncourt held that, inasmuch as the charitable dispensations of the institution could\\nonly reach a certain designated sex within a prescribed -age and baptized in a\\ncertain faith, the institution was not a,\" purely public charity.\" and was, there-\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', '96 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\nfore, subject to taxation. On appeal. this view was at first sustained by the Su-\\npieme Court.\\nAfterwards, however, a rehearing was granted, and the former judgment was\\nreversed and a judgment entered in favor of the defendant, excepting its prop-\\nerty from taxation. In its final opinion the court, among other things, said:\\n\" It is conceded that the devise has created a charity which is in a sense public,\\nbut it is urgpd that it is not \" purely public.\" Now it must be conceded, and it\\nhas been decided, that the word 1, purely \\'\" is not to have its largest and broadest\\nsignificance when used in this connection. Without doubt an asylum for the\\nsupport of fifty blind men or an equal number of paupers would not be obnoxious\\nto the objection that it was not purely public. A charity for the maintenance\\nof disabled seamen or of aged and infirm stonemasons would undoubtedly be a\\npurely public charity, and so also would a charity for the education and main-\\ntenance of the children of such persons. and if such charity should be limited to\\nthe white female orphan children of such persons between the ages of four and\\neight years, such limitations, though they would greatly restrict the number and\\nclass of beneficiaries, would constitute no objection to the purely public char-\\nacter of the charity. Why, then, would not a charity for the support of poor\\nEpiscopalians. Catholics. Jews or Presbyterians of a State or city be a purely\\npublic charity ? No private gain or profit is subserved: the objects of such a\\ncharity are certain and definite, and the persons benefitted are indefinite within\\nthe specified class. The circumstance that the beneficiaries are to be of a parr\\nticular fa\\' h is only of importance as designating the class. As to the meaning\\nof the v d \" purely,\" when used in this connection. we concur in the construc-\\ntion g\\' by the Supreme Court of Ohio in the case of Gerke v. Purcell, 25 Ohio\\nState, tage 229; that is, \\'when the charity-is public, the exclusion of all idea of\\ngain or private profit is equivalent in effect to the forc4 of the word \" purely\"\\nas applied to \" public charity * in the Constitution.\\' \"\\nSee Burd Orphan Asylum v. School District. 90 Pa. St., 21.\\nAgain, the Supreme Court of Kentucky, in Zabet v. Louisville Baptist Orphan\\nHome. 17 :. W. Rep., page 212, says: \" It\\'is urged that the appellee renders no\\npublic service. and that therefore the Legislature could not constitutionally ex-\\nempt it from taxation. It is, however, a charity, and as such renders a public\\nservice. Its very name indicates its object and entitles it to privilege and grat-\\nitude. It is the duty of the State to care for its indigent orphans, and if done by\\nanother. he renders what is properly a publiv, service, and the Legislature may,\\ntherefore. without regard to the extent of it, exempt the property devoted to\\nsuch use from taxation.\"\\nSo far as can be determined from the charter, constitution, and by-laws of the\\norder in question, it is wholly devoid of any idea of business profit or gain what-\\never. But its principal object and purpose is to administer tender offices of\\ncharity and benevolence to the needy and distressed, who, but for the existence\\nof the order, would be dependent upon the public for support.\\nWe therefore conclude that the Grand Lodge I. 0. 0.

Section 37 of article XVI of the Constitution reads:\\n\" Mechanics. artisans. and material men of every class shall have a lien upon the\\nbuildings and articles made or repaired by them for the value of their labor done\\nthereon, or materiais furnished therefor. and the Legislature shall provide for\\nthe speedy and efficient enforcement of said lien.\"\\nThe law enacted in pursuance of this section now reads, \"Any person or firm,lumber dealers, artisan, laborer, mechanic or sub-contractor. who may labor or\\nfurnish material * * * to erect any house or improvement. or to repair any\\nbuilding or improvement whatever, * * * shall have a lien on such house,buildings. fixtures or improvements. and shall also have a lien on the lot or lots\\nof land necessarily connected therewith.\" This law could not be construed so\\nas to give a lien upon structures such as railroads.\\nTyler Tap Railroad Company v. Driscol. 52 Texas, 13.\\nTherefore if contractors can retain any lien upon railroads, it must be by\\nvirtue of what is known as the \" railroad laborers\\' lien law.\"\\nSection 35, article XVI of the Constitution of 1876 provides: \" The Legisla-\\nture shall, at its first session. pass laws to protect laborers on public buildings.\\nstreets. roads, railroads. canals and other similar public works. against the failure\\nof contractors and sub-contractors to pay their current wages when due. and to\\nmake the corporation. company or individual for whose benefit the work is done,\\nresponsible for their ultimate payment.\"\\nIn pursuance of this section the Legislature of 1879 passed the following law:\\n-All mechanics, laborers and operatives who may have performed labor in the\\nconstruction or repair of any railroad locomotive, car or other equipment to a\\nrailroad. or who may have performed labor in the operating of a railroad, and\\nto whom wages are due and owing, shall hereafter have a lien prior to all others\\nupon such.railroad and its equipments for such wages as are unpaid.\" General\\nLaws.

R. v. Allen & Humphreys. 1 White and Wilson. sec-\\ntion 568 et seq., the question was raised whether the lien could be retained for\\nteams and tools furnished. The court held that the lien is restricted to personal\\nlabor, and does not embrace teams. tools, etc. In rendering the opinion this\\nlanguage is used: \"The object and purpose of this statute is to secure to me-\\nchanics, laborers. and operatives. and no others. wages due or owing to them for\\nwork and labor done and performed in constructing, repairing. or operating the\\nroad.

John H. Reagan, Chairman Railroad Commission, Austin.\\nDEAR SiR-Your inquiry relative to the repeal of article 4257 of the Revised\\nStatutes by the passage of the act to create the Railroad Commission of Texas,\\nhas been duly considered. Your question is substantially whether or not said\\narticle 4257, in so far as it establishes a maximum rate which may be charged by\\nrailroad companies., is repealed by the act establishing the Railroad Commission.\\nArticle 4257, in so far as it affects the question presented. reads as follows:\\nRailroad companies may charge and receive not exceeding the rate of fifty\\ncents per hundred pounds per hundred miles for the transportation of freight\\nover their roads: but the charges for transportation on each class of freight shall\\nbe uniform. and no unjust discrimination in the rates or charges for the trans-\\nportation of any freight shall be made against any person or place on any rail-\\nroad in this State.\"\\nThe act to establish the Railroad Commission of Texas is entitled \"An act to\\nestablish a Railroad Commission for the State of Texas, whereby discrimination\\nand extortion in railroad charges may be prevented, and reasonable freight and\\npassenger tariffs may be established.,\" etc. Section I establishes the Commission\\nand provides for the appointment of the Couimissioners. Section 2 provides for\\nthe organization of the Commission; and section 3 prescribes the authority and\\ndeclares the duty of the Commission. Subdivision \"a\" of said section confers\\npower upon the Commission to classify and subdivide all freight. and subdivision\\nb\" provides that \"the Commission shall have power and it shall be its duty to\\nfix to each class or subdivision of freight a reasonable rate for each railroad.\\nsubject to the act for the transportation of each of said classes and subdivisions.\"\\nSubdivision \"d\" provides that the Commission may fix different rates for differ-\\nent roads. Subdivision \\'e\" authorizes the Commission to fix rates for connect-ing lines of road. Subdivision \"h\" confers upon the Commissiob the power andduty from time to time to alter. change. amend. or abolish any classification orrate established br it when deemed necessary. Subdivision \\'j\" provides that the\\nCommission shall make reasonable and just rates of charges for each railroad for\\nthe transportation of loaded and empty cars. Section 23 of said act declares thatall laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act are hereby repealed.Under well settled rules of construction, where there is an express repeal of\\nall laws and parts of laws in contlict with an act passed, it is evident that in the\\nlegislative mind there were other laws existing in the State in conflict with theprovisions of the act to which the declaration of repeal is made. It shows there-\\'fore an intention to repeal, and is not in a strict legal sense merely a repeal byimplication.\\nSection 154 of Sutherland on Statutory Construction lays down the followingrule: \" Though a subsequent statute be not repugnant in all its provisions to aformer, yet if it was clearly intended to prescribe the only rule which shouldgovern, it repeals the former statute,\" and in section 155, id., it is said: \" Where\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', 'REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 90\\nthere are two acts on the same subject. and a later embraces all the provisions of\\nthe first and also new provisions, the later act operates without any repealing\\nclause, as a repeal of the first.\"\\nThese propositions are sustained by numerous authorities.\\nHarris v. Watson, 56 Ark., 574.\\nPublishing Co. v. Whitney, 32 Pac. Rep.. 237.\\nBryan v. Sunberg 5 Texas, 418.\\nThe State v. Stoll, 17 Wall!, 425.\\nUnited States v. Tinen, 11 Wall., 88.\\nFayette County v. Harris, 44 Texas, 514.\\nTracy v. Tuffy. 134 U. S., 206.\\nAuthorities might be multiplied indefinitely upon this proposition. It seems\\nto us to be clear that the-primary object of the act of April 3. 1891. referred to,\\nwas to confer upon the commission the power to fix reasonable rates. Hereto-\\nfore that power was vested in railroad companies, subject to the limitation pre-\\nscribed in article 4257, that the rates should not exceed fifty cents per hundred\\npounds per hundred miles. If it should be held that the maximum rate therein\\nprescribed was not repealed, it seems that it would follow that the converse of\\nthe proposition would be true, and that the railroads would still be authorized to\\ncharge fifty cents per hundred pounds per hundred miles. It is clear to our\\nminds that the act of April 3. 1891, intended to prescribe, and does prescribe,\\nthe only rule as to freight obtaining in this State, and that article 457, in so far\\nas it fixes the maximum freight rate, is in conflict with the act of April 3, 1891,\\nand is therefore to that extent repealed.\\nSt. Louis Ry. Co. v. Kay. 22 S. W. Rep., 685.\\nIn the last cited case the question was as to whether article 279 of the Revised\\nStatutes was repealed by the act of April 2, 1887. Article 279 refers to all car-\\nriers indiscriminately. The act of April 2. 1887, refers only to railroads. The\\ncourt say that in the case presented there is no necessary inconsistency or re-\\npugnancy between the two statutes. but \" it seems to us that the later statute\\nwas intended to cover the whole field as to railroad companies, and to lay down\\nthe only rule for a recovery against them for the particular wrong it points out.\\nFor these reasons we think article 279. in so far as it relates to railroad corpor-\\nations. is repealed by article 4227.\" (Act of April 2. 1887.)\\nWe believe that the act establishing the Railroad Commission \\'prescribes the\\nonly rule of regulation of freight rates, and that it was intended to cover the\\nwhole subject imatter, and it therefore repeals article 4257 as above indicated.\\nVery respectfully.\\n(Signed) FRANK ANDREWS,\\nOffice Assistant Attorney General.\\nTranscribing County Records.-County clerk is entitled to receive fifteen cents for\\ntranscribing old records of a county under article 4281 of the Revised Statutes.\\nATTORNEY GENERAL\\'S OFFICE,\\nAUSTIN, June 21, 1894.\\nG.

I beg to say article 3361a, Sayles\\' Statutes, provides that after the re-\\nmoval of the disabilities of minority. said minor shall be deemed and held for\\nall legal purposes of full age. and shall be held responsible, and shall have all\\nthe privileges and advantages as if he were of full age. saving only that he shall\\nnot vote until he arrives at the age of twenty-one years. You will note that the\\nConstitution requires that a person shall be twenty-one years of age in order to\\nvote. but there is no such provision with reference to holding the office of county\\nattorney. Articles 249 and 251, Sayles\\' Statutes, provide that the county attor-\\nney shall be duly licensed to practice law in the District Courts of this State.\\nand shall reside in the county for which be was elected. There is no provision\\nof law nor clause in the Constitution which requires a county attorney to be\\ntwenty-one years old. This being the case, we conclude that after the removal\\nof the disabilities of a minor, and after he.hwelseen duly licensed to practice law\\nin the District Courts of this State, atrd\\'Isf idiident of the county, he is eligible\\nto the office of county attorney. , I\\nIn discussing this question our court used the following language: \" Eligi-\\nbility to oflice is not declared as a right or principle by any express terms of the\\nConstitution, but it rests as a just deduction from the express powers and pro-\\nvisions of the system. The basis of the principle is the absolute liberty of the\\nelectors and the appointing authorities to choose and appoint any person who is\\nnot made ineligible by the Constitution. Eligibility to office belongs, therefore,\\nnot exclusively or specially to electors enjoying the right of suffrage. It belongs\\nequally to all persons whomsoever not excluded by the Constitution. When a\\nConstitution has been framed which contains no provision defining in terms who\\nshall be eligible to office, there is strength in the argument that the intention was\\nto confide the selection to the untrammeled will of the electors.

To reiterate. you are entitle(] to charge coniuis-\\nsions of one-half of one per cent on money coming into your hands as permanent\\nschool fund of the county: you are also entitled to a like commission for dis-\\nbursing this fund.

The commissions are not to be paid out of\\nthe permanent school fund. but must be paid out of the available school fund of\\nthe county.\\nGeneral Laws Twenty-second Legislature. page 142.\\nIn answer to your second question. it has been held that where county bonds\\nissued for the purpose of making public improvements are sold an( the proceeds\\nturned over to the contractor. the county treasurer is entitled to receive a coim-\\nmission: in such case it may be that the treasurer does not actually handle the\\nmoney. but lie is held to be the proper custodian of county funds an( should be\\npermitted to handle the proceeds of the bonds, and is held, therefore, to be enti-\\ntied to commissions on the amount.\\nWall v. McConnell, 65 Texas, 401.\\nOn the other hand. it is held that where county bonds are issued and are not\\nsold, but are paid directly to the contractor. the county treasurer is not entitled\\nto commissions. The Supreme Court makes the distinction between these two\\nclasses of transactions very clear. and it is of the opinion that county treasurers\\nare no more entitled to receive commissions on bonds paid directly to the con-\\ntractor than he would be to receive a commission on a promissory note or other\\nevidence of pecuniary obligation issued by the county to the contractor.\\nMcKinney v.

The fact that appellant failed to give and\\nhave entered of record the required notice of appeal to confer jurisdiction on the\\nCourt of Criminal Appeals. will in no manner lessen the liability of him and his\\nsureties on his recognizance; he could not. thus. by his own laches and neglect.\\nrelieve himself of a valid judgment of your County Court. If the Court of Crimi-\\nnal Appeals\\'had acquired jurisdiction and afirmel the cas and he then failed\\nto appear in accordance with the conditions of his recognizance. then. under all\\nthe authorities, the sureties would be liable. In a case like this, when no affirm-\\nance is had. but the appeal is simply dismisse( with the order that the appellant\\npay the costs of appeal. there is no statutory direction as to the procedure in such\\na case, nor is there any decision by our appellate court which indicates the rule.\\nThen, in view of the silence of the statute and the absence of judicial construe-\\ntion, it can not be said that the question presented is altogether free from doubt:\\nit is not believed. however, that the mere silence of the statute in the precise\\nquestion indicated will leave the State without remedy when the defendant fails\\nto appear before the trial court -- from day to day and term to term an( not de-\\npart without leave of the court. in order to abide the judgment of tihe Court of\\nCriminal Appeals.- Where the defendant fails to appear, as in this case. his\\nrecognizance should he forfeited under article 440 et seq..

Code of Criminal Procedure. the right to forfeit a recognizance on appeal is\\nlimited to cases of allirmance of the judgment of the trial court, and that in all\\ncases other than an affirmance the bail bond is the obligation to proceed upon.\\nThis position seems to be supported by the case of Wells v.

The fact that such\\' petition was granted and the\\nlaw put in force for the last general election is not sufficient to continue the law\\nin force after such election.-- This conclusion follows from the language of the\\nact providing for registration. So much of said act as is necessary to a decision\\nof the questions presented by you reads as follows: \" There shall. upon the\\npetition of five hundred citizens of such city. be. prior to each general election.\\neither State. county, or municipal. had a registration of all voters in said city.\"\\nSection 1. p. 13.

Again, there is considerable expense incurred by\\nthe enforcement of the registration act. This expense is paid out of the general\\nfund of the county in State-and county elections, and out of the general fund of\\nthe city in city elections. Section 10. p. 14.

This it seems would be necessary in order to constitute a charge\\nupon the general funds of the city for the payment of the expense of conducting\\nregistration. It is the evident purpose of the registration act to permit cities of\\nten thousand inhabitants to invoke its provisions when desired. but not to force-\\nthem to accept same in all elections, whether State or municipal.

Another clause of article 2396 provides a fee of\\none dollar for posting the advertisement for sale under execution or any order\\nof sale.

Smt-Jn response to your verbal inquiry, 1 have made a careful investi-\\ngation of the question as to whether or not the Constitution, article 5. section 2,as amended September 22, 1891, fixes absolutely the salaries of the justices of the\\nSupreme Court of this State and the salaries of the judges of the Court of Crimi-\\nnal Appeals at four thousand dollars. Said section provides that the ChiefJustice and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court \" shall each receive an\\nannual salary of four thousand dollars, until otherwise provided by law.\" Sec-\\ntion 4 of said amended article provides that the judges of the Court of Criminal\\nAppeals shall have the same qualifications and receive the same salaries of the\\njudges of the Supreme Qourt. The question. tersely stated, would be. whether\\nthis provision of the Constitution is self-executing and fixes the salaries of these\\notlicers by its own terms, or whether legislation is necessary in order to fix the\\nsame. 7\\nThe Constitution of 1876, article 5. section 2, provided that the Chief Justice\\nand Associate Justices shall each receive an annual salary of not more than $3550.\\nThere was no statute regulating the salaries of these officers, and an annual ap-\\npropriation. in obedience to the terms of the Constitution. of 93550 has been\\nmade since its adoption for each of said officers. The amendment above quoted,\\nwhich was declared adopted September 22, superseded the Constitution of 1876,\\nand became. at the time of its adoption, the controlling law, and determined and\\nfixed the salaries of these officers at four thousand dollars per annum until other-\\nwise provided by the Legislature.\\nIn the case of Watson v. Aiken, 55 Texas, 536, a similar constitutional pro-\\nvision was held to be self-executing, regarding the legal rate of inte\\'rest. Sec-\\ntion 11, article XVI. of the Constitution provided substantially that all interest\\ncharged above 12 per cent shall be deemed usurious and the Legislature shall at\\nits first session provide appropriate pains and penalties to punish usury. In the\\nabove case it was held that any contract for a greater rate of interest than 12 per\\ncent was illegal, and that the interest could not be collected, notwithstanding\\nthat the Legislature had enacted no law providing appropriate pains and penal-\\nties. In the case submitted the amended Constitution is the only law now in\\nexistence which fixes the salaries of the justices of the Supreme Court. and it is\\nthe paramount law and needs no legislative action to give it force. The Legis-\\nlature has authority to change the salary provided for under the Constitution.\\nbut until such cbange has been made by the Legislature the salaries remain at\\nfour thousand dollars.\\n(Signed) 1cry respectfully.

Pugh, addressed to you, in which he asks how\\nbe can be released from a saloon bond. referredoby you to this department, is re-\\nceived.\\nYou are respectfully advised that there is no provision of law which author-\\nizes the release of a surety on the bond mentioned. Section 4. page 59, of the\\nact of 1887. provides that any person engaging in the sale of spirituous. vinous\\nor malt liquors shall, before engaging in such occupation. be required to enter\\ninto a bond in the sum-of five thousand dollars, with at least two good and suffli-\\ncient sureties. Said act further provides. in addition to civil proceedings for\\nindividual injuries brought on said bond, that if the principal shall violate any\\nof the conditions of the bond the district or county attorney may institute suit\\nthereon in the name of the State for the use and benefit of the county., and the\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', '48 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\namount of five hundred dollars shall be recovered from the principal and sure-\\nties upon any breach of the conditions thereof.\\nWe infer from the letter that the principal on the bond in question has violated\\nits provisions; if notice of this fact is brought to the district or county attorney\\nin the district where the saloon is located, he wpuld no doubt immediately insti-\\ntute suit for a breach of its conditions. In the event of such breach we know of\\nno provision of law which would release the surety from liability. Will say,\\nhowever, that section 5 of said act provides: -If any county clerk shall issue a\\nlicense to any dealer in intoxicating liquors, without first requiring the bond\\nprovided for in this act, lie shall be fined not less than one hundred nor more\\nthan five hundred dollars.\" Under this provision this department holds that at\\nthe expiration of the time for which license was issued. it is necessary for a new\\nhond to be filed and approved.

The contention appears to be that articles 423 and 424 of the Revised\\nCivil Statutes require the Comptroller to register bonds which have been for-\\nwarded to him accompanied by a statement of the taxable values and tax levies.\\nwithout regard to the validity of the bonds or the legality of the tax levies.\\nArticle 42:3 provides: \\'\\' It shall be the duty of the mayor, whenever any bond\\nor bonds are issued, to forward the same to the Comptroller of Public Accounts\\nof the State. whose duty it shall be to register said bond or bonds in a book kept\\nfor that purpose. and to endorse on each bond so registered his certificate of\\nregistration. and to give at the request of the mayor his certificate certifying to\\nthe amount of bonds so registered in his office up to (late.\"\\nWithout. in this connection. considering article -124 at all. it is apparent that\\nthere devolves primarily upon the Comptroller the necessity of determining if\\nbonds had been issued by the city, If his duties be considered as entirely minis-\\nterial. there still devolves upon him the necessity of arriving at a conclusion as\\nto whether or not circumstances have arisen which would require the exercise of\\nhis official functions. It is certainly not every piece of lithographed paper that\\nmay be forwarded to the Comptroller that must be registered. The mere circum-\\nstance that the mayor and secretary of a city sign a piece of paper, upon which\\nis printed a recitation to the effect that the city will pay so much to bearer at a\\ndesignated time, does not create an obligation against the city, and does not\\nmake a bond issued by the city.

A bond is evidence of indebtedness. Upon the existence of the debt the\\nexistence of the bond is dependent.\\nIn the case of Bank v. Terrell, 78 Texas, 450, this language is used: \" While\\nour Constitution authorizes the creation of a debt * * * its mandate is im-\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', 'REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 49\\nperative that no such debt shall be created without making provision at the time\\nof its creation to assess and collect annually a suficient sum to pay interest thereon\\n,and create a sinking fund of at least two per cent on the principal. Until this is\\ndore the debt is not created and none exists.\"\\nThe action of the Comptroller is predicated upon the issue by a city of bonds;\\nthe bonds are dependent upon the creation of a debt; the debt is dependent upon\\ncompliance with the constitutional requirements regarding the levy of taxes. Ifit should appear to the Comptroller that no adequate tax levy has been made.\\nwould it also not appear that no duty devolved upon him with reference to what\\nmerely purported to be bonds of the city?\\nOne of the purposes which article 423 evidently intended to accomplish was to\\ngive notice to the world of the obligations outstanding of the city; it was to\\nbenefit alike the investing public and the debtor city. The former could examine\\nthis record in an investigation of a contemplated investment, the latter could\\nexhibit it as evidence that the authority of the city to issue bonds had not been\\nexceeded. The book of registration would serve much the same purpose with\\nregard to cities that the mortgage record of a county would with regard to an\\nindividual. If the construction contended for should be given, this salutary pur-\\npose of the law would be defeated, and instead of giving notice of the obligations\\nof the city, the certificate would. at least until it became understood that regis-\\ntration was merely nonsense prescribed by law, serve as an instrument to aid un-\\nscrupulous oflicials to defraud the innocent and unsuspecting.\\nBut registration was intended to more than merely give notice of the amount\\nof city bonds issued. The certificate placed upon the bond was expected to per-\\nform a still more important function. It was to be evidence that the bond upon\\nwhich it had been placed had been brought to the attention of an officer charged\\nthenceforth with the duty of seeing that the purchaser of the bond be paid the\\ninterest thereon as it fell due., and that provision be made for the payment of the\\nprincipal. Article 424 is to the effect, -that it shall be the duty of the mayor at\\nthe time of forwarding any of said bonds for registration, to furnish the Comp-\\ntroller with a statement of the value of all taxable property. real and personal,\\nin the city: also, with a statement of the amount of tax levied for the-\\'payment\\nof interest and to create a sinking fund. It is hereby made the duty of the Comp-\\ntroller to see that a tax is levied and collected by the city suflicient to pay the\\ninterest semi-annually on all bonds issued. and to create a sinking fund sufficient\\nto pay the said bonds at maturity, and that said sinking fund is invested in good\\ninterest-bearing securities.,\\nA duty is here imposed upon the Comptroller to be performed for the benefit\\nof the bondholders; the certificate is an earnest to the purchaser that the Comp-\\ntroller has assumed its discharge.\\nThe duty placed by the law upon the Comptroller. it would le impossible for\\nhim to perform if the bonds were not valid. 1le could not \"see that a tax is levied\\nand collected by the city sufficient to pay interest and create a sinking fund\"\\nif no debt was created by the city council in attempting to issue bonds. By\\nregistering bonds that were invalid, he would place it beyond his power to comply\\nwith the balance of the law. That construction certainly will not be given the\\nlaw which would require of the Comptroller that which is impossible. In order\\nto prevent the occurrence of such contingency provision is made by the law that\\nat the time bonds are forwarded for registration. the Comptroller be furnished\\nwith a statement of the value of all taxable property and of the taxes levied. This\\nis certainly the purpose for which these statements are required. If this be not\\ntrue, what other purpose was in contemplation ? No provision is made for their\\npreservation or record; no provision is made to the effect that the city should\\nbe estopped from denying the facts which they purport to recite.

It appears from the statements that the assessment\\nof the tax was properly made, and it is not shown but what the rolls were prop-\\nerly made out by the assessor and duly approved by the commissioners court as\\nrequired by law. In due time the taxes were paid. It seems that afterwards it\\nwas discovered by some one that the court only intended to assess the property\\nat three-fourths of its value. and at the regular term of the court in February,1893. an order was entered which purported to correct the assessment and reduce\\nit to three-fourths of its cash value, and ordered one-fourth of the county taxes\\nto be paild back to the bank.\\nThe question propounded by you is. whether. under the circumstances stated,\\nyou. as Comptroller of Public Accounts of this State, have the authority to re-\\nfund to the bank one-fourth of the State taxes so paid.\\nAmple rules are made for the protection of the citizens from excessive valua-\\ntion of property and the payment of excessive taxes thereon, but the remedy pro-\\nvided for in the statute must he pursued.\\nArticle 1517a, Sayles\\' Statutes. provides that the county commissioners courts\\nof the several counties of this State shall convene and sit as a board of equaliza-\\ntion on the second Monday in June. or as soon thereafter as practicable before\\nthe first day of July. to receive all tie assessment lists or books of the assessors\\nof their counties for their inspection. correction. equalization. and approval.\\nSection 2 of the same article provides that the board shall cause the assessor to\\nbring before them all the assessment books of the county for their inspection, to\\nsee that each and every person has rendered its property at its fair market value\\nas contemplated by law.

The position of Librarian is\\ntherefore evidently not considered or treated by the Legislature as an office, as\\nthe clerk of the Supreme Court is ex officio librarian.\\nThere is, however, one other question to be considered. Article XVI, sec-\\ntion 33. of the Constitution, provides that the accounting officers of this State\\nshall neither draw nor pay a warrant upon the treasurer in favor of any person\\nfor salary or compensation as agent, officer or appointee who holds at the same\\ntime any other position of honor, trust or profit under this State or the United\\nStates, except as prescribed in this chapter. Under the provisions of the Con-stitution first cited it will be seen that it was entirely competent for the Legis-lature to provide such compensation as it saw fit for the services of the clerk of\\nthe Supreme Court, and it also had authority to impose upon the incumbent of\\nthat office such additional duties as to the Legislature seemed proper, not incon-\\nsistent with his duties as clerk of the Supreme Court. The duties of the libra-\\nrian of the Supreme Court are not believed to be inconsistent with the duties of\\nthe clerk of the Supreme Court. and there seems to be no good reason why the\\nduties of librarian may not be imposed upon and discharged by the clerk of the\\nSupreme Court. The general appropriation bills for the years 1893 and 1894 ap-\\npropriated, under the head of \"\\' Supreme Court,\" for clerk\\'s salary, $2500 each\\nyear, and under the same head, \\'\" Salary of librarian at Austin, $720 each year.\"\\nIt must be presumed that the Legislature made this appropriation with a\\nknowledge of the law which constitutes the clerk of the Supreme Court librarian\\nfor said court. and places in his charge the safe keeping of the Supreme Court\\nlibrary. and with knowledge that the Legislature has heretofore annually appro-\\npriated various sums for the librarian, while the clerk of the Supreme Court\\nheld that position and received the pay. The power being by the Constitution\\nvested in the Legislature to fix the compensation of the clerk at such sum as it\\nsaw fit, his compensation was by law fixed at $2500 per annum, and in addition\\nto this the Legislature appropriated for his services in the care and control of\\nthe library the sum of $720 per annum. These items should be construed\\ntogether, and both be given effect if possible. It is plain that no other person\\nthan the clerk of the Supreme Court can draw the salary appropriated for a\\nlibrarian, because that officer is expressly constituted librarian by the law above\\ncited, and the Legislature had knowledge of this when both these items were\\npassed.

Comptroller, Austin.\\nDEAR Sim-We have a communication from your department requesting the\\nopinion of this department upon a question propounded to you by R. E. L. Tom-\\nlinson, county clerk of Falls county, of date May 31. The questions propounded\\nare: \" Whether or not a party who pays an occupation tax to the tax collector\\nmust file the tax collector\\'s receipt with the county clerk. and have the clerk\\nissue an occupation license to the person filing the receipt? If the clerk must\\nissue the license and if he is entitled to the fee therefor; if so, what fee?\"\\nIn support of the proposition that this course should be pursued. article 945\\nof the Revised Statutes is cited. That article provides. in substance, that upon\\npresentation of receipts for occupation taxes, the county clerk shall issue a\\nlicense to the person paying the tax, authorizing him to pursue the occupation\\nnamed in the receipt during the time for which he has paid the tax. Prior to\\nthe act of 1870, upon the subject of occupation taxes and the manner of keeping\\naccounts with collectors, the law regulating the keeping of such accounts was\\ndifferent from that prescribed in the act of 1879 (General Laws. p. 143.) For-\\nmerly it was necessary for the county clerk to have the receipt presented to him\\nand to issue a license thereupon, and by this means keep a check upon the tax\\ncollector as to the amount of occupation taxes paid to that officer. .\\nThe act of 1879, however, provided a different method for keeping accounts\\nwith tax collectors, relative to occupation taxes. Section 9 of said act, which\\nwas also inserted by the codifier in the Revised Statutes, provides, in substance,\\nthat the Comptroller shall cause occupation tax receipts for each occupation, to\\nbe printed with his signature for all occupations payable to collectors, and for-\\nward the same to each collector. and charge him with the amounts represented\\nby the receipts sent him, and cause him to account therefor. It also requires\\nthe collector to keep stubs and to report to the Comptroller. It further contains\\nthe following provision: \"And no person shall pursue any occupation unless he\\nhas a receipt signed as herein provided by the Comptroller and collector.\" This\\nclearly means that every person having such receipt may pursue the occupation.\\nIt is believed that the Legislature intended to provide and did provide a differ-\\nent system of keeping accounts upon tax collecters, and intended, among other\\nthings. by such amendment to relieve the tax-payer of the unnecessary burden\\nof contributing to the county clerk a fee for the issuance of a license based upon\\na receipt, when the receipt would answer all practical purposes, and the Comp-\\ntroller would have a check upon the collector for all receipts issued. It is not\\nbelieved therefore that the law requires any person to take out a license from\\nthe county clerk to pursue an occupation after he has paid his occupation tax\\nand received his receipt from the tax collector. This view is strengthened by afurther act of the Legislature subsequent to the act of 1879, which expressly re-\\nquires a person pursuing the occupation of a---iquor dealer to pay an occupation\\ntax and to apply to the clerk for a license for theatursuit of such occupation.\\nWhere the statute does not otherwise require -tbe issuance of a license by the-\\nclerk, it is not believed that the person pursding the occupation is required to.\\ntake the same out.\\nVery respectfully,\\n(Signed) FRANK ANDREWS.\\nOffice Assistant Attorney GeneraL\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', '58 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\nPrinting Board.- When the Printing Board has refused to audit an account for pub-\\nlic printing, the Comptroller has no authority to draw a warrant upon the Treas-\\nurer.for payment of the same.

In whom is vested the authority to fill the vacancy in the officeof the clerk of the District and County Courts of Rains county, which has a\\npopulation of less than eight thousand inhabitants.\\nSection 9 of article V of the Constitution provides there shall be elected adistrict clerk for each county, and in case of vacancy the judge of the District\\nCourt shall-have power to appoint a clerk. By section 20 of article V of the\\nConstitution, it is provided that a county clerk shall be elected for each county,and that a vacancy in said office shall be filled by the Commissioners\\' Court,,Provided, that in counties having a population of less than eight thousand\\npersons there may be an election of a single clerk, who shall perform the duties\\n-of district and county clerks.\" The statutes (articles 1101, 1115, 1116a, 1143,\\nard 1159) contain similar provisions. In the county of Rains, at the general\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', 'REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 59\\nelection in 1892, one person was chosen to discharge the duties of these two offices,\\nand having died since his qualification, the question submitted is, By whom\\nshall the vacancy be filled ?\\nThe Constitution does not command the election of only one clerk In counties\\n\\'with a population of less than eight thousand. Mere authority for such action\\nis there given. This authority has been exercised by the Legislature, however,\\nand it has expressly enacted that in such counties \" only one clerk shall be\\nelected.\"\\nRevised Statutes, articles 1, 115, 1159.\\nAlthough both the Constitution and the statutes employ the terms \" election\"\\nand \" elected \" only in this connection, yet it appears clear that the statute espe-\\n-cially evidences a legislative intention that only one person shall discharge the\\nduties of district and county clerk in such counties. That the Legislature so\\nintended when there is an election is manifest, and no reason is perceived for a\\ndifferent rule where an appointment is made. The ground for such action is not\\nthat there is an election rather than an appointment. but that there are less than\\neight thousand people in the county, and until the law unmistakably rests the\\ndistinction upon the narrower reason of election instead of appointment, it can\\nnot logically be adopted.\\nBeing of the opinion therefore that only one person can be appointed to the\\nvacancy, the more diflictilt question arises, By whom shall he be designated ? It\\nis believed the appointment is confided by the Constitution to the Coimnissioners\\nCourt of Rains county. It is well known that the duties of county clerk are\\nmore important and affect more intimately a larger number of citizens of the\\ncounty than those of the district clerk. and it is to be presumed that in consoli-dating these ollices the piurpose was to merge the least into the more important.\\nand to lodge the appointive power in officials of the localities most concerned\\nand interested. It will he noted, also. that the authority of the (listriet judges to\\nfill vacancies in the oflice of district clerk is for temporary purposes. and the\\nperson appointed shall hold only -- until the oflice can be tilled by election.\" It\\nis true the Legislature has not provided for a special election in the former case.\\nbut 1no one will doubt its authority to do so under this constitutional provision.\\nSo far as the Constitution bears on the question, the authority given the district\\njudge to appoint was not intended as a permanent induction into office, though\\nthe statute seeks to make it such. The power given the Commissioners Court,\\non the contrary, extends to filling the vacancy for the balance of the constjtu-\\ntional term of two years, and this difference should certainly have some weight\\nin determining the question which authority should be superseded in case of ap-\\nparent conflict.\\nRlegardless of these minor considerations, the conclusion reached is, in my\\njudgment. the proper construction of the Constitution. Sections 9 and 20 of\\narticle V should be construed together, and thus considered it is believed that in\\nall counties with a population of more than eight thousand persons the district\\njudge is authorized to fill vacancies in the office of district clerk; and in coun-\\nties with a population of less than eight t housand persons, when only one per-\\nson discharges the duties of district and county clerk, the power to fill vacancies\\nis lodged in the Commissioners Courts. It will certainly not be contended that\\nthe Constitution confides the authority jointly to the district judge and Commis-\\nsioners Court. Besides the want of definite language indicating such purpose,\\nits manifest incongruity places it beyond serious contemplation. Section 9.\\nwhich alone confers power in this particular upon district judges, is silent both\\nas to the consolidation of the offices and, the person authorized to fill vacancies\\nin such cases. Such .is not the case, however, with section 20. Providing for\\nthe election of county clerks, it also prescribes that vacancies in those offices\\nshall be filled by the Commissioners Courts, and in the same sentence authorizes\\na consolidation of the offices. The proviso in this section which authorizes \\'the.\\nconsolidation has.immediate reference to the paragraph that a county clerk shall\\nbe elected for each county, and defining his duties. Generally -peaking, the of-\\nfice of a proviso is to impose a limitation or condition upon a preceding clause.\\nand in this case, read in the light of the context, the condition is only upon the\\nduties to be performed.', \"Section 9.\\nwhich alone confers power in this particular upon district judges, is silent both\\nas to the consolidation of the offices and, the person authorized to fill vacancies\\nin such cases.

IV. L. Mc Gaughey, Commissioner General Land Office, Austin.\\nDEAR SIR-I reply to your letter of the 21st instant with reference to the sale\\nof timbered land. A communication from Messrs. Mantooth & Townsend, of\\nLufkin, with whom you have. I presume from your letter, had correspondence,has also had consideration in the same connection.\\nThe questions presented may be succinctly stated:\\nMay lands classified as \" timbered\" be sold to persons other than actual set-\\ntlers?\\nMay more than one section of timbered land be sold to one purchaser?\\nSection 3 of the act of April 1, 1887, regarding the sale and lease of school and\\nother public lands (General Laws 1887, page 52). makes provision for the classi-\\nfication of lands belonging to.the funds mentioned, into \"agricultural, pasture,\\nand timber lands.\" Section 5. as amended in 1889 (General Laws 18,9. page 51),\\nprovides that when the classification has been made \" such land (that is the land\\nclassified) shall be subject to sale, but to actual settlers only \" in quantities be-\\ntween 80 and 640 acres. There is an exception to this limitation, to the effect\\nthat lands classified as \" purely pasture lands, and without permanent water\\nthereon,\" may be sold in quantities not exceeding four sections to the same set-\\ntler. It will be noted that the exception is not to land other than agricultural,but extends only to a portion of the lands classified as pasture lands. It will be\\nfurther noted that even the excepted lands must be sold to the actual settler.\\nThe proviso does not include -- timbered lands.\"\\nSection 7 fixes the prices of the several classes, placing lands \"valuable chiefly\\nfor the timber thereon \" at a minimum of five dollars.\\nSection 8. as amended in 1889, provides for sale to a former purchaser of an\\nagricultural or watered section of three ^ strictly pastoral\" sections. The pro-\\nvision is not extended to timbered lands.\\nSection 9 makes it the duty of the Commissioner to prescribe regulations\\nwhereby all purchasers shall be required to \" reside upon as a home the land pur-\\nchased by them for three consecutive years next succeeding the (late of their\\npurchase.\" This section also requires an affidavit that the purchaser desires the\\nland as a home and has settled thereon. It also prescribes the terms of pay-\\nmnent. and to the regulations then made there is a proviso to the effect that if\\nthe land applied for be -timbered land.\" the purchaser shall pay cash in full at\\nthe time of purchase.\\nSection 13, as amended in 1889. is with reference to timber and timbered land\\nexclusively. It gives the Commissioner authority to adopt such regulations re-\\ngarding the sale of timber on timbered land as may be deemed necessary; pre-\\nscribes minimum prices of timber per acre. and period within which purchaser\\nmust remove timber. In it there appears the following: \" and in no case * * *\\nshall less than one section of timbered land be sold to any one purchaser.\" The\\nsection is concluded with this proviso: \"All timbered lands from which the\\ntimber has been cut and taken off may be placed on the market and sold for\\nnot less than two dollars per acre, as other lands are sold under the provisions of\\nthis act.\"\\nAll sections of the act having a bearing upon the question submitted having\\nbeen reviewed, the law may be thus summarized: Lands having been classified\\nas agricultural, pasture. or timbered may be sold to actual settlers only in quan-\\ntities, of agricultural land of not less than 80 acres or more than 640 acres; of\\npasture lands, same with named exceptions: of timbered lands, not more nor less\\nthan one section.\\nThe conclusion reached therefore from a strict and literal construction of the\\nlaw, is that both interrogatories must be answered in the negative.\\nIt is suggested. however, that it was the intention of the Legislature to apply\\nthe provisions of the statute requiring settlement and continued occupancy, and\\nprescribing a limitation as to the amount thatmight be purchased, to agricultural\\nand pasture lands only.', 'All sections of the act having a bearing upon the question submitted having\\nbeen reviewed, the law may be thus summarized: Lands having been classified\\nas agricultural, pasture. or timbered may be sold to actual settlers only in quan-\\ntities, of agricultural land of not less than 80 acres or more than 640 acres; of\\npasture lands, same with named exceptions: of timbered lands, not more nor less\\nthan one section.\\nThe conclusion reached therefore from a strict and literal construction of the\\nlaw, is that both interrogatories must be answered in the negative.\\nIt is suggested. however, that it was the intention of the Legislature to apply\\nthe provisions of the statute requiring settlement and continued occupancy, and\\nprescribing a limitation as to the amount thatmight be purchased, to agricultural\\nand pasture lands only.\\nIt may be that a different rule might with propriety have been prescribed with\\nreference to lands valuable chiefly for the timber and with regard to agricultural\\nlands.\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', 'REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\nIt is doubtless also true that in most cases ownership of a single section of tim-\\nbered land will not justify the erection of saw-mills or the construction of ways.\\nof transportation of saw-logs. In fact, it may be that the terms of the law as\\nhere construed preclude the possibility, ordinarily, of sale of timbered land.\\nHowever this may be, the opinion is entertained that this is not a case in which\\nthe legislative intent may be looked to in order to fiestroy the plain terms of the\\nlegislative act. \" Courts are not at liberty to spequlate upon the intentions of\\nthe Legislature when the words are clear, and to coil strue an act upon their own\\nnotions of what ought to have been enacted. While it is the duty of one attempt-\\ning the interpretation of a statute to ascertain its intent, yet the statute itself\\nfurnished the best means of its own exposition.\"\\nThere are not in this law grammatical ambiguities., clauses or phrases that are\\nabsurd, provisions contradictory or inconsistent with the main proposition. I\\ndo not conceive it a case in which that which the Legislature has done maly be\\ndisregarded, in order that that which the Legislature might have intended to\\ndo may be so considered. I do not conceive it a case in which the certain im-\\nport of language may be ignored in order that a court, or an officer charged\\nwith interpretation, may enter the conjectural field of public policy.\\nIn an effort, however, to ascertain if possible that which the Legislature in-\\ntended should be done, the writer has examined carefully the journals of the\\nSenate and House of the Twentieth Legislature. by whom the law was passed,\\nand has attempted to become familiar with the circumstances attendant with the\\npassage of the bill and with the conditions that required its enactment.\\nIt appears that the original bill, or committee substitutetherefor, was a com-\\nplete and symmetrical measure. The general provisions of the bif were sub-\\njected to an exception with reference to timbered land, expressed lsection 13.\\nThis section placed the sale of timbered lands almost entirely within th~discre-\\ntion of the Commissioner. as it places now sale of timber within his diicretion.\\nAmendments were made that had the effect to entirely change the purport of the\\nsection. Except as to a single provision. which has been quoted, its provisions\\nwere made applicable to timber instead.of timbered land.\\nIf more than the language of the law is to be looked to in attempting to deter-\\nmine the legislative intent. it would not be improper to consider in that connec-\\ntion the history of this section. A proposition was made that the Commissioner\\nof the Land )fice be given authority to sell timbered lands, under such rules as\\nhe might prescribe. This proposition was repudiated, but authority was given\\nto sell timber at discretion.\\nThere can be no inference that the Legislature intended to do that which it\\nrefused to do.

John D MrcCall, Comptroller.\\nDEAR Si-Your letter of May 5, regarding the registration of bonds by the\\ncity of Laredo, was duly received. A determination of the question submitted\\nhas required an exhaustive examination of all the laws which have been passed\\nby the Legislature with reference to the incorporation of cities and towns, and a\\ncareful study of the constitutional prov- ions affecting taxation. This fact will\\nexplain delay in the reply.\\nYou ask, substantially. whether cities of more than ten thousand inhabitants.\\nincorporated under the general laws. may issue bonds in excess of an amount\\nthat a tax of twenty-five cents on the $100 valuation will pay interest on and\\ncreate a necessary fund suflicient for their redemption at maturity.\\n\\'The first general incorporation.law passed in this State was approved J\\' a ry27: 1858. (Chapter 1, General Laws 1858, page 69.) This law drew a stine-\\ntion between villages and towns. and towns and cities. Its first section p vided\\nfor the incorporation of a village of more than three hundred inhabitants into a\\ntown. Its 36th section provided for the incorporation of a village or town con-\\ntaining fifteen hundred inhabitants into a city.\\nThe only provision with reference to taxation was the 18th section, which pro-\\nvided that the board of aldermen should have power to levy taxes, not to exceed\\nfifty cents on the one hundred dollars. This law remained unamended until 1873,when by an act approved May 26, 1873 (chapter 65. General Laws 1873, page 98),section 1 was so changed as to provide that where a village or town may contain\\na population of two hundred souls,\\'it might be incorporated as a town in the\\nmanner prescribed by the act.\\nOn March 15. 1875, an act was passed 1* regulating the incorporation of cities\\nof one thousand inhabitants or over.\" etc. This act was evidently intended to\\ncover the entire subject of municipal corporations. containing 158 sections, and\\ncovering substantially every matter that could properly be the subject of munici-\\npal regulation.\\nIt provided, however, no terms upon which a city or town not incorporated\\ncould be incorporated. The first section was to the effect, \"that any city con-\\ntaining one thousand inhabitants or over may accept the provisions of this act.\"\\nThe 157th section was, that \" the provisions of this act shall not apply to any\\ncity within the limits of this State until its acceptance by the city council of such\\ncity in accordance with the provisions of section 1 of this act.\" It had been the\\nuniversal custom before 1858 for cities and towns to incorporate by special act of\\nthe Legislature. After the act of 1858, incorporation under the general law was\\npermitted, but it appears that prior to the adoption of our present Constitution\\nthis was rarely done. Cities incorporated under that law and cities incorporated\\nunder special charters were permitted to adopt the law of 1875.\\nSection 81 of the act of 1875 provides \" that the city council shall have power\\nto annually levy and collect taxes, not exceeding 1 per cent; provided, that by\\nconsent of two-thirds of the voters of said city, the city council may levy and\\ncollect an additional tax, not exceeding I per cent.\"\\nThe authority to issue bonds is regulated by section 70, to the following effect:\\nThe city council shall have power \"to appropriate so much of the revenues of\\nthe city, emanating from whatever source, for the purpose of retiring and dis-\\ncharging the accrued indebtedness of the city. and for the purpose of improving\\nthe public markets and streets, erecting and conducting city hospitals, city halls.', 'Cities incorporated under that law and cities incorporated\\nunder special charters were permitted to adopt the law of 1875.\\nSection 81 of the act of 1875 provides \" that the city council shall have power\\nto annually levy and collect taxes, not exceeding 1 per cent; provided, that by\\nconsent of two-thirds of the voters of said city, the city council may levy and\\ncollect an additional tax, not exceeding I per cent.\"\\nThe authority to issue bonds is regulated by section 70, to the following effect:\\nThe city council shall have power \"to appropriate so much of the revenues of\\nthe city, emanating from whatever source, for the purpose of retiring and dis-\\ncharging the accrued indebtedness of the city. and for the purpose of improving\\nthe public markets and streets, erecting and conducting city hospitals, city halls.\\nwaterworks, and so forth, as they may from time to time deem expedient; and\\nin furtherance of these objects they shall have power to borrow money upon the\\ncredit of the city and issue coupon bonds of the city therefor, in such sum or\\nsums as they may deem expedient. to bear interest not exceeding 10 per cent per\\nannum, payable semi-annually at such places as may be fixed by city ordinance;\\nprovided, that the aggregate amount of bonds issued by the city council shall at\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', 'REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 65\\nno time exceed 6 per cent of the value of the property within said city subject to\\nad valorem tax.\"\\nSection 78 provided that said bonds should be signed by the mayor and coun-\\ntersigned by the secretary, payable at such places and at such times as may be\\nfixed by ordinance of the city council, not less than ten nor more than fifty\\nyears.\\n\" The act of 1875 was in force when our present Constitution took effect, and\\nremained in force thereafter, except in so far as it was repugnant to the Consti-\\ntution.\"\\nGould v. City of Paris, 68 Texas, 517.\\nSection 4, article XI, of the Constitution prescribes: \"Cities and towns hav-ing a population of ten thousand inhabitants or less may be chartered alone by\\ngeneral law. They may levy, assess and collect an annual tax to defray the cur-rent expenses of their local government, but such tax shall never exceed, for any\\none year, one-fourth of one per cent, and shall be collectible only in current\\nmoney.*\\nSection 5, article XI., of the Constitution is to the effect: \"Cities having more\\nthan ten thousand inhabitants may have their charters granted or amended by\\nspecial act of the Legislature., and may levy, assess and collect such taxes as may\\nbe authorized by law, but no tax for any purpose shall ever be lawful, for any\\none year, which shall exceed two and one-half per cent of the taxable property\\nof such city, and no debt shall ever be created by any city, unless at the same\\ntime provision be made to assess and collect annually a sufficient sum to pay the\\ninterest thereon and create a sinking fund of at least two per cent thereon.\"\\nSection 7 of this article makes provisions for the levy and collection of taxes\\nin cities on the Gulf of Mexico, and it has the following general clause: \" But\\nno debt for any purpose shall ever be incurred in any manner by any city or\\ncounty, unless provision is made at the time of creating the same for levying\\nand collecting a sufficient tax to pay the interest thereon and provide at least\\ntwo per cent as a sinking fund.\"\\nSee Terrell v. Bank, 78 Texas, 452.\\nSection 9 of article VIII of the Constitution, as originally adopted, was as fol-\\nlows: \"The State tax on property, exclusive of the tax necessary to pay the\\npublic debt, shall never exceed fifty cents on the one hundred dollars valuation,\\nand no county, city or town shall levy more than one-half of said State tax, ex-\\ncept for the payment of debts already incurred, and for the erection of public\\nbuildings, not to exceed fifty cents on the one hundred dollars in any one year,\\nexcept as in this Constitution is otherwise provided.\"\\nThe articles of the Constitution quoted must be taken and construed together,and the powers conferred on cities and towns may be thus summarized: Cities\\nand towns of less than ten thousand inhabitants could have levied a tax not ex-\\nceeding one-fourth of 1 per cent to defray current expenses. If a less sum than\\none-fourth of 1 per cent should have been sufficient to pay the current expenses.\\na tax of one-half of the State tax could have been levied, including the amount\\nlevied to defray current expenses.\\nGould v. City of Paris, 68 Texas, 51S.\\nFor payment of debts incurred prior to the adoption of the Constitution.\\nsuch tax as might have been necessary could have been levied.\\nCities having more than ten thousand inhabitants could have levied such tax\\nas might be authorized by law, not exceeding 21, per cent.\\nConstruing the sections of the Constitution quoted in connection with the law\\nof 1875, which was still in force, the following conclusions may be reachzd as to\\nthe power and authority to issue bonds after the adoption of the present Consti-\\ntution. The power of cities of less than ten thousand inhabitants being specific-\\nally set forth, and this power being limited by section 9 of article VI l of the\\nConstitution to exclude all other power to tax, section 81 of the act of 1875, so\\nfar as it applied to cities and towns of less than ten thousand inhabitants, was\\nrepealed and the section of the Constitution above quoted took its place.\\nThere was no necessary conflict between section 5, article XI of the Constitu-\\ntion and section 81 of the law, section 5 fixing the maximum of taxation and\\nsection 81 continuing to provide for the levy of \" such taxes as may be author-\\nized by law.\"', 'The power of cities of less than ten thousand inhabitants being specific-\\nally set forth, and this power being limited by section 9 of article VI l of the\\nConstitution to exclude all other power to tax, section 81 of the act of 1875, so\\nfar as it applied to cities and towns of less than ten thousand inhabitants, was\\nrepealed and the section of the Constitution above quoted took its place.\\nThere was no necessary conflict between section 5, article XI of the Constitu-\\ntion and section 81 of the law, section 5 fixing the maximum of taxation and\\nsection 81 continuing to provide for the levy of \" such taxes as may be author-\\nized by law.\"\\nThe power to issue bonds under section 76 was affected by the Constitution to\\nthis extent: First, no bonds could be issued without at the time of their issu-\\nA.

(2) For the erection of public buildings. Bonds for the last named pur-pose were limited to such an amount as a tax, not exceeding fifty cents on the\\none hundred dollars. would pay interest upon and create a sinking fund for ofat least 2 per cent. The bonds for indeotedness previously accrued were notlimited by any rate of taxation. Bonds for both these purposes must not aggre-\\ngate more than 6 per cent of the value of the property subject to tax. As none\\nof the purposes mentioned in section 76 could be the subject of bonded indebted-\\nness, except the two just mentioned, this rule would exclude bonds for the pur-\\npose of improving the public markets and streets, conducting city hospitals.erecting an(d conducting water works, and whatever improvements may have\\nbeen included under the very general expression -and so forth.\"\\nCities of ten thousand inhabitants continued, after the adoption of the Consti-\\ntutiion. to have the right to issue bonds for all purposes mentioned in section 76.\\nand no limitation was imposed upon this right except that at the time bonds were\\nissued provision must be made for their payment. an(d suclh provision could be\\nmfade under the Constitution and laws as they then existed to the extent men-\\ntioned in section 81.\\nEv the law of 1858. as amended in 1873. a distinctiou was made between towns\\nand villages containing two hundred inhabitants or more and towiis and cities\\ncontaining a population of fifteen hundred or more. The act of 1875 distin-\\nguished between towns an villages of two hundred anl less than one thousand\\ninhabitants anul cities with more than one thousand in habitants. By the (\\'on-\\nstitution of 1876, cities having more than ten thousand inhabitants were distin-\\nguished from cities and towns having a population of ten thousand inhabitants\\nor less.\\nIn Waxabachie v Brown. 67 Texas. 527. it is said. speaking of article Xl of\\ntile (Constitution : \"As to towns. there is no provision indicating any authority\\nto create a debt. nor any to issue bonds. except posSibly for the purpose of pay-\\ning any indebtedness which had accrued up to the time tile C onstitution went\\ninto etect.

By article 426 the distinction made by the Constitution between cities\\nhaving more than ten thousand inhabitants and cities having ten thousand or\\nless, is recognized, and cities of the former class are given, in the language of\\nthe Constitution, \" authority to levy. assess and collect such taxes as may be\\nauthorized by law, not to exceed 2, per cent of the taxable property of such\\ncitv.\" This is the only place in the statute where, in terms, cities of this class\\nare distinguished from other cities having more than one thousand inhabitants.\\nTo the distinction clearly made by the Constitution, the Legislature. in the\\nadoption of the Revised Statutes. paid little attention, it perhaps being thought\\nthat advantage would be taken of the authority given the Legislature to incor-\\nporate cities of more than ten thousand inhabitants under special charters. It\\nwas suggested in Muller v. City of Denison. 21 Southwestern Reporter, page\\n392. the graver burdens and the more important functions of cities of the latter\\nclass demanded the difference in the extent of the powers conferred.\" As a\\nmatter of fact. the burdens and functions imposed by law upon cities of the two\\nclasses are exactly the same. However this may be. this case is authority for the\\nproposition that section 426 put into effect the constitutional provision author-\\nizing a tax of 2 ., per cent in cities of more than ten thousand inhabitants.\\nTo again define the authority of the cities of the different classes, the follow-\\ning authority as to taxation and indebtedness existed after the adoption of the\\nRevised Statutes of 1879: Cities and towns of more than one thousand inhabi-\\ntants. and not more than ten thousand inhabitants. had authority to levy and\\ncollect taxes, not exceeding one-fourth of one per cent. This was conferred by\\narticle 425. which is a copy of a portion of article 1. section 4. of the Constitu-\\ntion; it imphedly repealed all former authority to levy taxes and did not confer\\nupon city courfeils as much authority as would have been warranted under arti-\\ncle Vi1, section 9 of the Constitution. This article. as to cities of ten thousand\\ninhabitants or less. operated as a repeal of section 81 of the law of 1875.\\nArticle 420 of the Revised Statutes was a re-enactment of section 76 of the law\\nof 1875, but inasmuch as sections 5 and 7 of article XI of the Constitution re-\\nquired provision to be made for the payment of interest and the creation of a\\nsinking fund when bonds were issued, and inasmuch as it must be construed\\nthat article 425 was passed in response to the constitutional provision, which\\nprovided for a tax of one-fourth of one per cent for the current expenses of\\nthe city, and inasmuch as only some of the purposes mentioned in the article\\ncould be construed as current expenses, this article was practically ineffectual\\nso far as cities of less than ten thousand inhabitants were concerned; or at all\\nevents the limit of 6 per cent of the taxable values prescribed by article 420 was\\nfurther reduced by article 425, which defined, and by defining. limited the\\npower of taxation. Unless it be held that article IX. section 8. of the Constitu-\\ntion. taken together with article XI, section 6. of the Constitution. were self-\\nexecuting, no provision was made even for the issuance of bonds to pay indebt-\\nness that had accrued prior to the adoption of the Constitution. because at no\\nother place is authority to levy a tax for this purpose given.\\nCities of more than ten thousand inhabitants had, after the adoption of the\\nRevised Statutes. authority, according to Muller v.

[General\\nLaws 1885, chapter 107. page 99.]\\nThis act was intended to affect cities of ten thousand inhabitants or less only.\\nThis conclusion is reached from the circumstance that it purports to be an affirm-\\native grant of power. from the circumstance that it has no repealing clause. that\\ncities of more than ten thousand inhabitants had, prior to this time, the rights\\nwhich are here conferred. This conclusion is further reinforced by the recita-\\ntions in section 2 of the act. to the following effect: \" Whereas, many cities\\nand towns of this State are without the necessary funds to defray the expense\\nof erecting public buildings and other needed permanent improvements for the\\nreason that no law has been enacted to conform the tax law of such cities and\\ntown to the amended Constitution, etc.\" The law was evidently passed in con-\\nformity with the constitutional amendment of 1883. This amendment did not\\naffect the taxing power of cities of more than ten thousand inhabitants. Cities\\nof this class, incorporated un der the generaL laws were not \" without the neces-\\nsary funds to defray the expense of erecting public buildings and other needed\\npermanent improvements for the reason that they were not authorized to levy\\nthe requisite tax;\" on the contrary. they had the authority to levy the requisite-\\ntax. After the passage of this law. cities of more than ten thousand inhabitants\\ncontinued with authority to levy a tax of 21 per cent and to issue bonds to the\\namount of 0 per cent of the taxable values.\\nThe case of Muller v. Citv of Denison is authority for the proposition that the\\nact of Marcli 23. 1887, which will hereafter be discussed, does not operate as a\\nrepeal of article 426. If this be true, then there can be no doubt of the correct-\\nness of the proposition just made.\\nWe are brought to the act of March 23. 1887. and to the construction of its\\neffect upon the authority of cities to levy taxes and issue bonds. This was en-\\ntitled \"An act to authorize cities and towns to levy and collect taxes for the con-\\nstruction or purchase of public.buildings. water works. sewers, improvements of\\nstreets. and other permanent improvements, and to issue bonds therefor, and to\\nrepeal all laws in conflict herewith.\" It provides for the levy and collection of\\na tax sufficient to meet the interest and sinking fund on all indebtedness incurred\\nprior to the adoption of the constitutional amendment of 1883; for the levy and\\ncollection of a tax of twenty-five cents for current expenses: for the levy and col-\\nlection of an additional tax of twenty-five cents for the construction or the pur-\\nchase of public buildings. water works. sewers. streets, or other permanent im-\\nprovements within the limits of such city or town; and it provides that for such\\nimprovements such city shall have the power to issue coupon bonds of the city\\ntherefor, but it is provided that the -aggregate amount of bonds issued for the\\npurpose named shall never reach an amount where the tax of one-fourth of one\\nper cent will not pay current interest and provide a sinking fund sufficient to pay\\nthe principal at maturity, and the amount of bonds legally issued under acts\\npassed prior to the adoption of the present Constitution shall not be computed in\\nestimating the amount of bonds which may be issued for the above named city\\nimprovements.\" Section 2 repeals all laws in conflict with the get.

Section 2 of the law repeals all\\nlaws in conflict with this act. This would perhaps result without such a repeal-ing clause. One law without a repealing clause supersedes a prior one to the.extent of a conflict. The question then arises as to whether or not a conflict ex-ists. Under the decisions cited. this permit of an additional tax does not in anymanner conflict with the tax which cities of ten thousand inhabitants or more\\nwere already permitted to levy. Why, then, should it be held that this bondissue. based upon this tax, dependent upon it. comes in conflict with the author-ity given cities of. more than ten thousand inhabitants to issue bonds dependent\\nand based upon an entirely different and independent levy? How, indeed,\\nleaving these views out of consideration, can it be said that the giving here of\\nthis authority to issue bonds providing for the improvements here mentioned,\\ncomes in conflict with authority previously given to issue bonds for some of the\\npurposes here named and for other purposes ? Could it not be as easily held a\\n.cumulative right. a cumulative authority ? Glancing over the laws which have\\nbeen mentioned, it will appear that from the adoption of the present Constitu-\\ntion up to the present time. every legislative act has been an extension of the\\nauthority of cities and towns with reference to taxation and the right to incur\\nindebtedness. A review of the same laws indicates that every extension has\\nbeen directed to cities and towns of less than ten thousand inhabitants, and that\\nup to the law of 1889, which will hereafter be reviewed. no amendment affecting\\ncities of more than ten thousand inhabitants was made to the law, unless by in-\\nference or implication.\\nArticle 426. as originally adopted, gave authority to levy a tax of twenty-five\\ncents on the oie hundred dollars in cities and towns of less than ten thousand in-\\nhabitants. When the Constitution was amended in 1883. this authority to tax\\nwas extended to conform to its provisions. This authority was again extended\\nin 1887, and there was attached to the power of taxation thus extended the right\\nto issue bonds. Article 426 and the constitutional provision upon which it was\\nbased, article V, section I1 of the Constitution, were independent primarily of\\nsection 8, article IX. of the Constitution, and the changes to that article fnd the\\nlegislation which has resulted from such changes have not affected them. Why\\nshould it be assumed that legislation evidently intended to enlarge the powers of\\none class of cities resulted by implication in the abridgement of the authority of\\nthe cities of another class? The plain intimation of the court in Muller v. City\\nof Denison, and the case of Texas Water and Gas Company v. Cleburne (21\\nSouthwestern Reporter, 391. 393). is to the effect that the legislation mentioned\\nhas affected cities of ten thousand inhabitants or less only. and has in no degree\\nabridged the powers or lessened the duties of cities of more than ten thousand\\ninhabitants.\\nAt no point in the history of legislation is article 420 of the Revised Statutes\\nin terms repealed.

TV. B. Hopkins. County Judge, Corpus Christi, Texas.\\nDEAR Sin-Your favor of June 4 has been duly considered. You state sub-\\nstantially, that during the years 1890-91 an epidemic of smallpox prevailed in\\nthe town of Corpus Christi. in the county of Nueces: that the city authorities\\ntook charge of affairs and spent about $3500 for the benefit and protection of\\nthe public health during said epidemic; that the commissioners court of Nueces\\ncounty as such never agreed with the city or undertook to bear any portion of\\nthe expense incurred by said city, though said court was in session several timesduring the prevalence of said epidemic; that at a meeting of said court subse-\\nquent to the incurring of said expense by said city a bill was presented by said\\ncity to said court for one-half the amount incurred by the city, and that at the-\\ntime the bill was presented the said court was composed of the same persons\\nthat were members thereof during the prevalence of the epidemic. and that by\\nunanimous vote of the court the account or bill was rejected; that at the May\\nterm. 1893, of said court said bill was again presented to said court and again.\\nrefused.\\nFrom your letter I deduce three propositions:\\nFirst. Is the county legally liable for any part of the expenses incurred by\\nthe city, and can the same be collected from the county by law?\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available .\", \"REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 71\\nSecond. If not-legally liable would it be competent for the Commissioners\\nCourt to appropriate any part of the county funds to the payment of any part of\\nthe expenses incurred by the city?\\nThird. Whether or not the action of the Commissioners Court in refusing to\\npay the claim was in the nature of a final judgment which settles the question or\\nmay it be opened and again repeatedly passed upon by the court from time to\\ntime?\\nIt seems that the first proposition must be answered in the negative. The city\\nauthorities had no power to contract a debt against the county without the con-\\nsent and authority of its Commissioners Court duly passed in an open session of\\nthat body. The said court never having agreed and undertaken to pay any part\\nof said expense. collection thereof cannot be. enforced by the city through the\\ncourts.\\nFears v. Nacogdoches county, 71 Texas, 337.\\nIn a former letter from this department, written before the claim was passed\\nupon by the court in the first instance, it was said in effect that as the county\\nhad authority to take proper action and make proper expenditure for the pro-\\ntection of the public health and co-operate with the city to accomplish this pur-\\npose it would be competent for the Commissioners Court to bear a pro rata partof the expense incurred by the city if said court saw proper to assume the obli-\\ngation, even after the expenditure was made. it being a purpose for which said\\ncourt might have contracted obligations if it had been shown to be necessary\\nfor the public health. No good reason now appears why this conclusion should\\nbe changed.\\nRev. Stats., 1520a. 4098, 409Sa, Laws 1891, p. 191, sec. 15.\\nIt appears, however, that the account of the city was presented to the Com-\\nmissioners Court and was by that body unanimously rejected.\\nThe question then presented is: Is it competent for the said court to again\\nconsider the question, or must it be considered as settled by the action of said\\ncourt at its former term? It is not believed that the action of said court was in\\nthe nature of a final judgment which renders the matter re- adjzidicata. but\\nrather that the action was of the same nature that would have been in the re-\\nfusal to pay any other claim against the county, or in refusing to do any other\\nact which it was competent for tbat court to do. While the auditing or refusal\\nto audit a claim may be considered quasi judicial, yet it is not believed that the\\nrefusal is a final judgment. as that term is judicially understood, and it would\\nb6 competent for the Commissioners Court to again consider the question at any\\nsubsequent term.\\nIn reply to your last question. as to whether this claim could be passed and\\nallowed by three commissioners, two of whom favor it, you are referred to\\narticle 1510. Revised Statutes, which provides that the fouI4 commissioners.\\ntogether with the county judge, shall compose the Commissioners' Court, and\\nthe county judge. when present, shall-be the presiding officer of said court.\\nUnder the law the county judge. as a member of said court, has the same power\\nand authority as any other member thereof, and may vote upon all questions\\nbefore the body for consideration. and in the case above stated it would be com-\\npetent for the county judge to cast his vote upon the proposition, and thus\\ncreate a tie and defeat the allowance of the claim. It is believed, therefore. that\\nas the Commissioners' Court would have had the authority to have made such an\\nexpenditure as was made by the city, that said court would have the authority\\nto assume an expenditure made by the city for this purpose, if in the exercise of\\na sound discretion it saw proper so to do, and this notwithstanding the court\\nmay have formerly refused to allow any part of the claim.\\n(Signed) Very respectfully, FRANK ANDREWS,\\nOffice Assistant Attorney General.\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available\", '72 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\nResidence on School Land.-A purchaser of school land under the act of 1887; tWho\\nprior to the expiration of the three years\\' occupancy required. has been elected\\n(rountU clerk of his county, and removes temporarily from his section, intending to\\nreturn to it upon the conclusion o~f his term of otflce, in the meantime improving it\\nand claiming it as his permanent home, has complied with all the requirements of\\nlaw and is entitled to a patent.\\nATTORNEY GENERAL\\'S OFFICE,\\nAUSTIN, June 30, 1893.\\nlon.

Texas.\\nDEAR SIR-The complaintof the citizens df Houston. submitted by vou, that\\nthe Houston and Texas Central Railroad Comphny has violated the laws of the\\nState in removing its land department from that city to the city of San Antonio.\\nhas been carefully considered. The material facts appear to be that this cum-\\npany is practically the successor of the Houston and Texas Central Railway\\nCompany. and now operates the road formerly owned by the latter company:\\nthat by its charter its principal office is fixed at the city of Houston, and that\\nrecently what is termed the -- land department\" of the company. consisting of\\nits land commissioner and clerks, and all books. documents, and records per-\\ntaining thereto, have been removed to San Antonio. and all the business of that\\ndepartment is now being transacted there. Since the complaint was made it is\\nunderstood the books. documents. and records which pertain to their right of\\nway. town lots, and depot and switching facilities, the use of which enters into\\nthe operation of the road. have been returned to Houston and placed in charge\\nof a competent official. leaving at San Antonio only such records as affect\\nthe lands claimed to have been granted the original company by the State. It\\nis insisted by the Land Commissioner that the present company is not the owner\\nand does not control any of the lands donated by the State, and consequently has\\nno \"land department \" in charge of such lands, but that the lands are owned\\nand controlled by a private individual. For several reasons the contention can-\\nnot be sustained, but in the view taken of the case it is unnecessary to enter\\ninto a discussion of this matter. Assuming that these lands are owned and con-\\ntrolled by the company now operating the road, the question presented is-\\nwhether our laws require railway companies to keep and maintain their land de-\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', '76 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\npartinent, to which are given the sale, lease and general custody of lands do-\\nnated by the State, and not used or available in the operation of their roads, at\\n.the place where the general offices are located.\\nThe Constitution (article X. section 3) requires railway companies to keep a\\npublic office In this State. The first Legislature which convened after the\\n-adoption of the Constitution required them to maintain a public office on the\\nline of their road in this State (Laws 1876, page 144), and this requirement was\\nretained (Revised Statutes. article 4115) in the Revision of 1879. There was no\\n-other legislation on this subject until the passage of the act of March 28, 1885\\n(General Laws 1885, p. 67), in which it was provided that railway companies\\nshould have and maintain a public office in the locality where their principal\\nbusiness is carried on in this State. on the line of their roads, for the transaction\\nof their business, \" where transfers of stock shall be made, where the auditor,treasurer. general traffic manager, and general superintendent of such roads, or\\nwhere an agent of such corporation, duly authorized tp adjust and settle all\\nclaims against such corporation for damages, shall have their respective offices,\\nand where shall be kept for the inspection of the stockholders.\" and such officers\\nor agents of the State as may be authorized to inspect them, the books of the\\ncompanies showing the capital stock. ownership thereof, amount paid, transfers\\nof stock. amounts of assets and liabilities and the names and places of residence\\nof their officers.\\nThe only other legislation applicable to the subject is the act approved March\\n27. 1889. By the first section of this act it is provided, among other things, that\\nevery railroad company chartered by this State or owning or operating any line\\nof railway within this Sttite shall keep and maintain permanently its general\\noilices within this State at the place named in its charter for the location of its\\n.general otlices. So much of section 2 as is pertinent to this inquiry is as follows:\\n** It shall be the duty of said railroad company to keep and maintain at the place\\nwithin this State where its general offices are located, the office of the president\\nor vice president. also the oflices of its secretary, treasurer, local treasurer,\\nauditor, gineral freight agent. traffic manager, general manager, general super-\\nintendent, general passenger and ticket agent. chief engineer, superintendent of\\nmotive power and machinery, master mechanic. master of transportation, train\\nmaster, stock and fuel agent, claim agent, and each and every one of its general\\noffices shall be kept and maintained; by whatever name it is known, and the per-\\nsons who perform the duties of said general offices. by whatever name known,\\nshall keep and maintain their offices at the place where the general offices of said\\nrailroad are required by law to be kept and maintained; and if the duties of any\\nof the above named offices are performed by any person. but his position is called\\nby a different name. it is hereby made the duty of said railroad company to have\\nand maintain said oflices at the place where its general Texas offices are kept and\\nmaintained as required by this act, * * * the object and meaning of this stat-\\nute being to require every railroad company owning or operating a line of rail-\\nway within this State, to keep and maintain its general offices within this State at\\nsuch places as required herein, and the name of the above as general offices shall\\nnot be understood to allow the railroad company to have any of the offices usually\\nknown as general oflices at any other place than the one it is required to keep its\\ngeneral offices at, and each and every railroad is hereby required to have and\\nmaintain its general oflices at the place named herein.\"\\nFrom this statement it is apparent that if the land department of this company\\nis one of its general offices within the meaning of these statutes, it must be kept\\nand maintained permanently at Houston. This is the sole question to be deter-\\nmined.', 'From this statement it is apparent that if the land department of this company\\nis one of its general offices within the meaning of these statutes, it must be kept\\nand maintained permanently at Houston. This is the sole question to be deter-\\nmined. If the act of 1885, in its application to this subject, may not be con-\\nsidered as superseded by the act of 1889. it is manifest that the land department\\nis not included in the offices there named, for the commissioner is neither\\nauditor, treasurer, general traffic manager, nor general superintendent, nor does\\nlie perform any of the duties usually discharged by such officers, nor is he an\\nagent of the company authorized to settle and adjust claims against it for dam-\\nages, nor the custodian of the books required to be kept by the act. It is equally\\nplain that it is not included in the act of 1889 eo nomine, and whether it is em-\\nbraced in certain general provisions of the act is the difficult question presented.\\nThe first section of the act requires, without naming them, that the \" general\\noffices\" of the company shall be kept and maintained at the place where its \"gen-\\neral offices are located. the office of the president or vice president,\\' etc., and by\\nthis the Legislature seems to have intended to enumerate the general officers who\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', 'REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 77\\nshall reside and keep their offices at that place, adding the general clause that\\n\" each and every one of its general offices shall be so kept and maintained. by\\nwhatever name it is known. and the persons who perform the duties of said gen-\\neral offices, by whatever name known, shall keep and maintain their offices at the-\\nplace where said general offices are required to be located and maintained, and\\nthe persons holding said general offices of a railroad shall reside at the place and\\nkeep and maintain their offices at the place where the general offices of said rail-\\nroad are required by law to be kept and maintained; and if the duties of any of\\nthe above named offices are performed by any person, but his position is called\\nbya different name. it is hereby made the duty of said railroad company to have\\nand maintain said offices at the place where its general Texas offices are kept and\\nmaintained as required by this act.\" an(d that \\' the name of the above as general\\noffices shall not be understood to allow the railroad company to have any of the\\noffices usually -known as general offices at any other place.\" The first of these\\ngeneral provisions refers in terms to the preceding enumeration of officers. and\\nconsequently is not more comprehensive; and. regarding the purpose of the act,\\nthe use of the words \" usually known as general offices\" in the second section\\nwas not intended to do more than supply the possible omission of offices con-\\nnected with the operation of the road as a railway and of a kindred nature to\\nthose previously named. The purpose of the act is to deal only with officers of\\nthe company whose duties pertain to its business as a common carrier of freight\\nand passengers.\\nThis construction accords with the history and policy of this legislation.\\nPrior to the act of 1885 many of the railways of the State were controlled by an\\nillegal combination, ind such of their general offices as are named in said act\\nwere kept and maintined in other States. All business in charge of the general\\nsuperintendents, general managers. treasurers. auditors. freight and passenger\\nagents. and claim agents were transacted there. All complaints of passengers\\nand shippers were required to wait upon the tedious and unsatisfactory process\\nof adjustment under such a system. Unquestionably the Constitution required\\nthe maintenance of a public oflice in the State. but legislation was necessary to\\nenumerate the several offices and provide adequate penalties. and consequently\\nthis act was passed. The policy of this and subsequent legislation rests largely\\nin the convenience of the people. and is indicative of its-purpose. The officials\\nof the companies charged with their management, brought together on their\\nlines. can more rapidly and satisfactorily discharg? their duties: obviously more\\npeople living on the line of roads have business with the companies as common\\ncarriers than elsewhere. and public interests are subserved by the concentration\\nand maintaining of such offices on the line of road. These considerations, how-\\never, do not affect the land department. for it can neither be said that the com-\\nmissioner can conduct the business more advantageously at some point on the\\nroad. nor that purchasers and lessees will be more numerous along the line of\\nrailway.\\nThe history of the act of 1889 is particularly significant of its bearing upon\\nthis question. The Texas and Pacific Railway Company contracted to locate and\\nmaintain permanently its general offices. roundhouses and machine shops at\\nMarshall, and did locate them there. About 1884 the land department of\\nthat company, which had been maintained at Marshall, was removed to Dallas:\\nand afterwards the company removed its general otlices to Dallas. It is well\\nknown that the law of 1889. the authors of which represented Marshall in the\\nIhegislature. was intended to have particular application to that case. yet while\\nit was understood that the land department had been removed, and while the\\nrepresentatives of that city exercised the precaution to enumerate all general\\noflices connected with the operation of the road whose designation was known.\\nand by general provision to guard against changes of destination and every\\ncharacter of evasion, this department was not named. In view of these facts and\\nthe apparent ambiguity of the law, this ommission must be given controlling\\nweight.\\nContrary to my first impression. I am of the opinion that the land department\\nof this company, as now conducted at San Antonio, is not one of the general\\noffices within the meaning of the statutes.\\nVery truly yours, -\\n(Signed) C.A.

G, 7. and S of the act -of July 8. 1879, and does not amend the sections\\nof said last act relative to forfeiture and transfer of the lands.\\nSection 15 of the act of 1879 provides that if any purchaser desires to sell said\\nland after he has made his first payment on the same, be may do so; but in that\\nevent his vendee shall file in the General Land Officeta properly authenticated\\ntransfer from said purchaser. and said vendee shall be liable to the obligations\\nand penalties imposed upon said original purchaser. It may be that the declara-\\ntion in this section that the vendee shall be liable to the obligations and penal-\\nties imposed upon said original purchaser is tantamount to a declaration that\\nwhen the obligations and liabilities are so assumed bv the subsequent vendee.\\nthe original purchaser shall be released from all further liability. If the original\\npurchaser had sold the land and the transfer. properly authenticated. was filed\\nin the General Land YOflice. and lie thereby became released from further lia-\\nbility. and parted with his interest in the land. he would neither be a necessary\\nnor a proper party to the suit. B ut. however this may be. the subsequent ven-\\ndee of the original purchaser who held the transfer from the original purchaser\\nwould not only be a proper but a necessary party to the suit to obtain a valid\\nj*ugment for the property sued for. and without such vendee being made a party\\nto the suit, his interest would not be concluded, because the lien of the State on\\nthe land is not expressly reserved. but arises by implication only.

Hamby, Member Penitentiary Board, Austin.\\nDEAR SIR-In reply to your favor of 11th instant, wherein you ask, whether\\nchapter 94, General Laws Twenty-third Legislature, is in conflict with section\\n49, article 3. of the Constitution of Texas, I beg to say the act in question in sub-\\nstance provides that the Penitentiary Board may, with the consent of the Gov-\\nernor, purchase agricultural lands or improved farms to the amount of three\\nhundred thousand dollars, for the purpose of establishing thereon State farms\\nand employing thereon convict labor on State account; that for making such\\npurchase the fund necessary therefor shall be loaned by the State Board of Edu-\\ncation to the Penitentiary Board out of the permanent school fund on certifi-\\ncates of indebtedness. issued by the Penitentiary Board and countersigned by the\\nGovernor; and that such loans shall bear interest at the rate of 5 per cent per\\nannum, and the principal shall be payable back to to the permanent school fund\\nin twenty annual installments of fifteen thousand dollars each.\\nIf the Penitentiary Board should make the purchase contemplated by said act,\\nthe faith and credit of the State would be pledged and the State become a debtor\\nto the permanent school fund in the sum of three hundred thousand dollars prin-\\ncipal, together with interest thereon at the rate of 5 per cent per annum. This\\ncan not be doubted. The act, it is true, provides that the purchase shall be made\\nby the Penitentiary Board. but, for obvious reasons, the purchase is for the\\nState, and provision is made for the payment of the debt thus created with the\\nreveniue of the State. The inhibitioin is against the creation of a debt by or on\\nbehalf of the State. The school fund is devoted exclusively to the support and\\nmaintenance of the public free schools. It can not be lawfully used for any other\\npurpose, though it may be invested in the securities named or provided for in\\nthe Constitution.\\nArticle VII, section 4.\\nIn this case the State offers and is authorized to borrow three hundred thous-\\nand dollars of the fund, and the question is, is it such a debt as may be created.\\nThe power of the State to create a debt is by section 49 of article III of the Con-\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available\", 'REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 81\\nstitution limited to the following language: \"No debt shall be created by or on\\nbehalf of the State, except to supply casual deficiencies of revenue, repel inva-sion, suppress insurrection. defend the State in war. or pay existing debt; and\\nthe debt created to supply defliencieg in the revenue, shall never exceed in the\\naggregate at any one time $200,000.\"\\nIf, then, the debt proposed by said act is permissible under the above clause\\nof the Constitution, the act is valid. We do not think, however, that the pur-\\nchase of agricultural and farming lands for the purpose of utilizing convict-\\nlabor thereon can be shid to come within the letter, spirit. or meaning of either-,\\nclass of cases wherein it is permissible for the State to pledge its credit underi\\nthe above quoted provision of the Constitution. There can, of course. be no\\npretense that the debt is to he created to repel invasion, suppress insurrection\\nor defend the State in war. It is not proposed to create it to pay existing debt.\\nThere is no casual deficiency in the revenue. and the act exceeds the constitu-\\ntional limit of such debt a hundred thousand dollars. The act is an undisguised\\nproposition to create a debt. not for any of the purposes named in the Constitu-\\ntion, but to purchase land on which to employ convict labor. The provision of\\nthe Constitution is clear. plain and explicit, and limits the power of the Leg-\\nislature to create any debt except for \\'the purposes therein enumerated. andwhatever reason may exist for creating a debt for any other purpose, we can-\\nnot disregard the plain provisions of the Constitution. The Constitution can-\\nnot be changed by the varying suggestions of public policy in the management\\nof State institutions, but the provisions therein contained having been inserted\\nby the people, must remain the inflexible law until altered by them.\\nYou are therefore respectfully advised that the act is unconstitutional and void.\\nVery respectfullv,\\n(Signed) MANN TRICE,\\nOffice Assistant Attorney General.\\nCommissions of Tax Assessor.-A. tax assesssor. for assessing taxes in special\\nschool districts, is entitled to receive a commission of one per centum upon the\\namount of the tax assessed against the district, and is not entitled to a commission\\nupon the amount of the property assessed.\\nATTORNEY GENERAL\"S OFFICE,\\nAUSTIN, October.17. 1893.\\n1?. E. Crozier. Esq., Tax Assessor. Cleburne. Texas.\\nDEAR Siit-Your favor of October 14, to the Comptroller. has been referred to\\nthis department for attention and reply. You state that you and the Commis-\\nsioners Court differ as to the compensation to be paid you for assessing the taxes\\nin special school districts. you contending that you are entitled to one per\\ncentum upon the value of the property assessed. and the C6mmissioners Court\\ncontending that you are only entitled to one per centum upon the amount of the\\ntax assessed against the property.\\nYour attention is called to section 48 of the act of 1893, regulating the public\\nfree schools of this State. The latter clause of said section provides that the\\ntax assessor shall receive a commission of one per centumn for assessing such tax,\\nand the tax collector a commission of one per centum for collecting the same.\\nYou will readily see that if the one per centumn to be paid the assessor is to be\\none per centum upon the value of the property assessed. you will be entitled to\\nreceive one dollar upon every hundred dollars worth of property situated in the\\ndistrict, whereas the law only authorizes a school district to levy a tax of twenty\\ncents on the one hundred dollars. You would thus be receiving five times as\\nmuch as the highest limit that could be levied on the district, and the district\\nwould of course come out very largely in debt. It is clear that the Legislature\\nin the language used intended that you should receive only one per centum upon\\nthe amount of the tax assessed against the district. To illustrate, if the district\\nhas fifty thousand dollars in taxable property and a tax of twenty cents is levied\\non each one hundred dollars, one thousand dollars would be the amount of the\\ntax assessed against the property and you would be entitled to receive one per\\ncent upon the thousand dollars assessed for the district.

General\\nLaws. pages 117. 118.It appears from an examination of the papers that the witness fees are claimed\\nin an examining trial had for the purpose of raising the defendant s bond. See-\\ntion 1 of the act above referred to provides that- any witness that may have been\\nrecognized or attached and given bond for his appearance before any court out\\nof the county of his residence, to give testimony in a felony case. and who shall\\nuppear in compliance with the obligations of such recognizance or bond. shall\\nhe allowed his actual traveling expenses. not exceeding three cents per mile go-\\ning to and returning from the court by the nearest practicable conveyance. and\\none dollar for each day he may be necessarily absent from home as a witness in\\nsuch case.-\\nThe real question to be determined is whether a habeas corpus or examining\\ntrial before a district judge for the purpose of raising a defendant\\'s bond is a\\n-- felony case* within the meaning of this section and the subsequent provisions\\nin the law.\\nA careful examination of the subsequent sections leads t ie conclusion that\\na felony case, as therein referred to, is an actual trial had u n the merits of the\\ncase. and that a witness must be attached or recognized for .rpose of giv-ing his testiniony upon a trial held upon the merits of the e d not upon a\\ntrial for the purpose of determining the amount of bail the defendant shall he\\nallowed.\\nIn addition to this. I am informed by your department that the uniform con-\\nstruction placed upon this law by your office for the past ten years has been that\\nno fees in such cases have been allowed. )uring this time the Legislature has\\nfrequently met. and. in its investigation of fees. etc., as appertaining to your\\ndepartment. .has had actual knowledge. through its committees,. of such con-\\nstruction. and the entire body has at least had constructive knowledge thereof,\\nand no new law has been enacted upon the subject. This strengthens the con-\\nstruction that a -fdlony case.\" within the meaning of said law. means an actual\\ntrial upon the merits of the case. and that the witnesses are attached and are\\nrecognized for that purpose.\\nWe, therefore, conclude that the law referred to does not provide fees for wit-\\nnesses in an examining trial or habeas corpus for the purpose of raising a de-\\nfendant\\'s bond.\\nThe accounts are herewith returned you.\\nVery respectfully,\\nFRANK ANDREWS.\\n(Signed) Office Assistant Attorney General.\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', 'REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 83\\nCounty Commissioner.-A county commissioner must be a resident of the precinct\\nwhich he represents, and a failure to reside in said precinct vacates the office.\\nATTORNEY GENERAL\\'S OFFICE.\\nAUSTIN, October 28. 1893.\\nlon.

E. Perrenot, Esq.. Victoria. Texas..\\nI)EAR Sm-Your favor of November 14th received. You state substantially\\nthat you are a married man. only twenty years old, and that your disabilities as\\na minor have been removed, and you inquire whether or not you are eligible\\nunder the laws of this State to bold the office of county clerk.\\nArticle 3361a, Savles\\' Civil Statutes. provides that after the removal of the\\ndisabilities of a minor the said minor shall be deemed and held for all legal pur-\\nposes of full age, and shall be held responsible and shall have all the privileges\\nand advantages as if he were of full age. saving only that he shall not vote until\\nhe arrives at the fulliage of twenty-one years. The statutes of this State do not\\nprescribe any particular age \\'for the office of county clerk. In this State that\\nparticular question has not been passed upon. In the 80th Texas. page 428,\\nSteusoff v. State, the question there presented was whether or not one not a\\nqualified voter for want of residence was eligible to the office of tax assessor.The court held that the person was eligible to the office, though not entitled to\\nvote. and in discussing the general rules of qualifications for office holding. Jus-\\ntice Gaines lays down the following: \" In Barker v. People, 3 Cowan, 703, the\\nChancellor who delivered the opinion of the court said: -Eligibility to office is\\nnot declared as a right by principle by any express terms of the Constitution,\\nbut it rests as a just deduction from the express powers and provisions of the\\nsystem. The basis of the principle is the absolute liberty of the electors and the\\nappointing authorities to choose and appoint any person who is not made ineli-\\ngible by the Constitution. Eligibility to office belongs, therefore. not exclu-sively or specially to electors enjoying the right of suffrage. It bdlongs equally\\nto all persons whomsoever not excluded by the Constitution.\\' When a Con-\\nstitution has been framed which contains no provision defining in terms who\\nshall be eligible to office, there is strength in the argument that the intention\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', '84 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\nwas to confide the election to the untrammeled will of the electors. Experience\\nteaches us that in popular elections those only are chosen who are in sympathy\\nwith the people both in thought and aspirations,,and that no law is needed to\\'\\nsecure the selection of those only who reside in the county or district in which\\ntheir functions are to be performed.\"\\nThis language by our Supreme Court seems to recognize the right of the elec-\\ntive or appointive power, in the absence of constitutional or legal restrictions,\\nto select such persons to fill the office as to them seem meet and proper, and in\\nview of the declarations in article 3361a above quoted. and of this declaration\\nby our Supreme Court. it is believed that you are eligible to the office of county\\nclerk.\\nVery respectfully,\\n(Signed) FRANK ANDREWS,\\nOffice Assistant Attorney General.\\nIssuance of bonds by Commissioners Court.-County Commissioners Court has no-\\nauthority to issue bonds for the purpose of building roads only.\\nATTORNEY GENERAL\\'S OFFICE.\\nAUSTIN, December 2. 1893.\\nCol.

In the opinion of this department such authority is not con-\\nferred upon the Commissioners Court. Chapter 84 of the Acts of 1893 provides\\nthat the counties of this State shall have authority to issue bonds \\' for pur-\\nchasing or constructing bridges for public purposes within the county or across\\na stream that constitutes a boundary line of a county.\" This, in our judgment,\\nwould not authorize the issuance of bonds to build roads permanent in their\\ncharacter, and such small bridges and culverts as might be necessary in building\\nthe roads, the primary object of the bonds being to acquire money with which\\nto build the road. We know of no statutory authority other than this bearing\\nupon the question. and we do not consider that this authority would justify the\\nissuance of bonds for such a purpose.\\nVery respectfully,\\n(Signed) FRANK ANDREWS.,Office Assigtant Attorney General.\\nElection-Removal of County Seat.-In an election held to determine the renwval ofa\\ncounty seat the county judge as returning officer has no authority to open the ballot\\nbox cnd count the ballots; he can only ascertain what are the true returns of the\\nelection, and having ascertained suchfacts. it is his duty to estimate the vote and\\ndeclare the re8ult as shown upon the face of the true returns made to him. .\\nATTORNEY GENERAL\\'s OFFICE,\\nAuSTIN, December 7, 1893.\\nHon.

You stati\\nthat on December 21 an election was held In Karnes county for the removal o\\nthe county seat; that charges of fraud and illegal voting have been made,,aut\\nthat while the returns from one voting precinct show that 190 votes were cast, i\\nhas been asserted by those intereqted that only 109 votes were cast in fact at sall\\nvoting box, and that one of the managers of the election at said box asserted the\\nonly 109 votes were in fact cast.

Sayles\\' Statutes,.provides for the manner of contesting such elec-\\ntions. but this article was declared unconstitutional by our Supreme Court in\\nHarrell v. Lynch.. 65 Texas, 146. It is therefore without force except in so faras it may aid in the construction of the statute bearing upon the question at bar,\\nas showing the legislative intent at the time of the passage of the act relative to\\nremoving county seats in 1879.\\nArticle 700. supra, also provides that such elections shall be conducted as near\\n-as may be as elections for county officers. The provision reasonably includes the\\nmanner of making returns and counting the same as well as other duties imposed\\nupon officers holding an election for county officers..\\nNo case is found or shown wherein our Supreme Court has passed upon the\\n-question presented. In Worsham v. Richards, 46 Texas, 441, it wasiheld by our\\nSupreme Court that the duty of ascertaining whether or not a place was within\\nfive miles of the geographical center of a county should be performed by the\\nCounty Court, and that in the event of fraudulent votes the matter could be\\nproperly contested before that court. notwithstanding no provision -for contest\\nwvas in the law as It then existed. Since that decision the law has been in many\\nmaterial respects amended, with a legislative view, no doubt, to meet the objec-\\ntions to the old law pointed out in that opinion. It could scarcely be considered\\nas an authority even by analogy under the present law. the County Court as then\\nconstituted being entirely different from our present County Courts, and also\\nour entire election system having been changed. The law. as it now is, does not\\n-confer upon the county judge any authority or jurisdiction to sit in a contest of\\nsuch an election. Nor is it believed that such authority can reasonably be in-\\nferred from that given, for that, the legislative mind is clearly expressed that\\nthe contest shall be elsewhere held. Article 702. supra.\\nThis is further made to appear by the amendment to article V. section 8, of\\nthe Constitution, adopted September 22, 1891. Under said section, prior to\\namendment, there was no jurisdiction conferred upon the District Court of such\\ncontested elections. The amendment expressly confers upon the District Court\\nthe original jurisdiction -of contested elections.\" It is believed. therefore, that\\nthe county judge has no jurisdiction in any capacity of a contest of such elec-\\ntion, and can. therefore. perform only the mipisterial duties imposed upon him\\nby statute as the returning officer of such election, the election in this case hav-\\ning been ordered by that officer. The rule as to a returning officer\\'s duty is thus\\nstated: \" They must receive and count the votes as shown by the returns, and\\nthey can not go behind the returns for any parpose.\" McCrary on Elections, sec-\\ntion 82.\\nThe same author, section 84. says: \" The doctrine that canvassing boards and\\nreturn judges are ministerial officers, possessing no discretionary or judicial\\npower, is settled in nearly or quite all theStates.\" Thesepropositionshavemany\\ncases cited under them which fully support the text.\\n\"\"The duties of county., district and State canvassers are generally ministerial.\\nThey are to determine the result shown by the returns, which are by law made\\nthe basis of their action.

If it be true that the salaries are thus fixed, the conclusion reached\\nnecessarily follows. But such is not believed to be the case. On September 30.\\n1893, you were advised in answer to an inquiry that the \" Legislature appropri-\\nated out of the general revenue the specific sum named for the maintenance and\\nsupport of the Medical Branch. and in addition appropriated the tuition fees the\\nstudents of said University might pay in.\" A careful re-examination of the\\nquestion convinces us that this is the proper construction of the act. for the\\nreasons given. The course proposed by the Board of Regents accords with this_\\nconstruction. If it be held that the specification of it in the act is tantamount\\nto a limitation upon the amount the Regents are authorized to pay for the pur-\\nposes respectively named, it will overthrow this interpretation, and lead logically\\nto the conclusion that the sum to be used for the support and maintenance of the\\nMedical Branch of the University is limited to the amount appropriated out of\\nthe general revenue. Obviously this would destroy that portion of the act ap-\\npropriating the matriculation fees of students supplementary to that taken from\\nthe general revenue. It is a familiar rule that that construction should if pos-\\nsible be adopted which will give effect to every provision of a law. It seems to\\nbe admitted that this is the true meaning of the act with reference to all items\\nexcept for the salaries of professors, demonstrators-of aniatomy and physiology,\\nprovost and janitor. it being insisted that no greater amount lnay be paid for\\nthe salaries of professors than g21.800, and that the salaries of the others named\\nare limited to the amounts specified. But there is nothing in the act which\\nshows an intention to discriminate in these cases by fixing the salaries and leav-\\ning without limit amounts used for laboratories. school of pharmacy, etc., and\\nunless such intention appears. such item must be held to be governed by the gen-\\neral.object of the law. Considered in connection with the authority expressly\\nconferred upon the Board of Regents to fix the salaries of professors and other\\nofficers (2 Sayles\\' Statutes, article 3681b. section 8), the Legislature by the act in\\nquestion appropriated for the support and -maintenance of the Medical Branch\\nof the University (1) the matriculation fees of students, and (2) an aggregate\\nsum out of the general revenue, the latter of which must be limited andsusedfor\\nthe purpose sspecifically pointed out in the act. The authority being expressly\\ngiven the Board of Regents by a general law to fix the salaries of professors and\\nother officers of the University, it would not be held to be revoked by an. appro-\\npriation bill unless such purpose unmistakably appears.\\nVery respectfully,\\n(Signed) C. 4.

This act was amended March 11. 1881, but in a particu-\\nlar not pertinent to your inquiry. By the act approved January 22, 1883, it isprovided that all of the public lands heretofore authorized to be sold under thetwo acts above referred to are withdrawn from sale; provided. that nothing con-\\ntained therein shall be construed to return said land to the mass of the public\\ndomain, but the same shall be considered to be reserved for the purposes for\\nwhich said land was originally set apart and designated by said act until theLegislature shall otherwise provide. It would seem from this to be clear that\\nthe public lands situated within the reservation, notwithstanding the fact that\\nthey have been withdrawn from sale, are yet reserved and set apart for the pur-\\nposes named in the act of July 14. 1879. and the amendment referred to. The\\nact of March 29,1889. is entitled \"An act to promote the development of the min-\\ning resources of Texas,\" and has for its purpose the \" sale of all the public school,\\nuniversity, asylum. an d public lands containing valuable mineral deposits.\"\\nSection 10 of the act provides that -any person or association of persons. quali-\\nfled as provided by section 1 of this act. shall have the right to locate and obtain\\na patent on any quantity of these lands containing deposits of coal, iron ore,\\nkaolin. marble, etc.\" The act approved May 2,1893. is an amendment to section\\n10 of the act of March 23, 1889, above referred to. and provides \"that any person\\nshall have the right to purchase and obtain patent, by compliance with this act,\\non any public school. university, asylum, and public lands containing valuable\\ndeposits of kaolin. etc.\" It is understood from your letter that the attempt is to\\npurchase, not public school, university or asylum. but public lands. The term\"public lands\" is no doubt used synonymously witD \"public domain\" which\\nhas been defined by our Supreme Court to be \"unappropriated public domain\"\\n(Day Co. v.

In your first question you state\\nsubstantially, that on the 12th day of February., at the regular term of the Com-\\nmissioners Court, the court duly created the office of county superintendent of\\npublic instruction for the county of Tyler. In pursuance of said act creating\\nsaid office, the court duly appointed a person properly qualified to the office thus\\ncreated; that such person did every act on his part necessary to qualify to said\\noffice, and tendered his bond to the Commissioners Court for approval, and that\\nthe court was thorougly satisfied with the validity of the bond so presented. On\\nthe 17th day of February, after the presentation of the bond, and after the oath\\nof office had been taken by the appointee. the court passed an order to abolish\\nsaid office. About these facts there is no controversy. The question presented\\nis, whetber or not the action taken by the Commissioners Court in the first in-\\nstance, and after the attempted qualification of the appointee. the court had\\nauthority to abolish the office to take effect immediately, or whether or not such\\naction could only take effect after the next election, that being the term for\\nwhich the appointee would be entitled to hold his office.\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available\", \"94 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\nSection 37 of the act of 1893, regulating the public free schools of this State,\\nprovides for the office of county superintendent of public Instruction. and au-thorizes the County Commissioners Court. when in their judgment they deem it\\nadvisable, to provide for the election of county superintendent of public instruc-\\ntion at each general election, and when the offlee is so created it is the duty ofthe court to appoint a superintendent. who shall perform the duties of such officeuntil a county superintendent shall have been elected as subsequently provided\\nin the act and shall have qualified. Subdivision (i) of said section provides that\\nthe County Commissioners Court shall have power to abolish the office of county\\nsuperintendent of public instruction by an order entered on the minutes of theircourt at a regular term thereof. Subdivision (j) of the same section provides\\nthat when the office is abolished the county superintendent shall serve out the\\nterm for which he was elected. There is perhaps no difference in the status of\\nan officer legally appointed by the Commissioners Court having proper authority\\nto make such appointment and one duly elected by the people at a general elec-\\ntion. It is also well known as a part of the history of this law that this limita-\\ntion upon the authority of the Commissioners Court to abolish the office was to\\nprevent the Commissioners Court from legislating a person out of office who\\nwas objectionable to that body. either personally or otherwise, and it is believed\\nthat the appointment would give the person the same status in the office that an elec-\\ntion would have given him. The question then arises as to whether or not the per-\\nson had been duly appointed to the office; that is. whether his appointment was\\ncomplete or whether it was subject to revocation. The authorities upon this\\npoint are perhaps not in entire accord. The weight of authority. however.\\nseems to be to the effect that where an officer has been appointed by a body con-\\npetent to make the appointment. and has done and stands ready to do all acts re-\\nquired of him in qualifying for the office, the appointment thus made is not\\nsubject to revocation. but is complete in so far as the appointing power is con-\\ncerned.\\nIn the case of State v. Barber., 58 Conn., 76. it was held, that where a joint con-\\nvention of the city council met for the purpose of making an appointment for\\nprosecuting attorney, and a ballot was properly taken, and one person received\\na majority of all the votes cast. and the result was announced by the presiding\\nofficer, and subsequently a motion was made to take another ballot, and some\\nother person was by motion declared elected, it was held that the appointment of\\nthe first person was complete and that he was entitled to the office and entitled to\\nqualify. See also Mechem on Public Officers. section 114, and authorities there\\ncited; Throop on Public Officers, sections 88 and 89. and authorities there cited.\\nFrom these we conclude that the weight of authority is to the effect that the\\nperson having been duly appointed by the Commissioners Court had a definite\\nand well defined term of ollice to fill, extending from the date of his appoint-\\nmnent until the election and qualification of his successor, and that under the\\nstatute he cannot be deprived of the office under the appointment so made until\\nthe expiration of his term. This question, however, has never been passed\\nupon. so far as I can ascertain, in this State, and if the Commissioners Court\\ncontinue to refuse to approve the bond, the appointee would of course have his\\nremedy at law. The question would by that means be definitly and positively\\nsettled.\\nVery respectfully.\\n(Signed) FRANK AN DREWS.\\nOffice Assistant Attorney General.\\nFranchise Tax.-I. 0. 0.

F.. of the State of Texas is exempt from the franchise tax imposed by chapter\\n102 of the acts of the Twenty-third Legislature, I beg to say that section 3 of\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available\", 'REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 95\\n-said act provides that each and every private domestic corporation. heretofore\\nchartered, or that may hereafter be chartered under the laws of this State, and\\neach and every foreign corporation that has received. or may hereafter receive.\\na permit to do business under the laws of this State, shall pay the Secretary of\\nState an annual franchise tax of ten dollars. Section 7 of the act expressly, ex-\\nempts from the payment of the tax. -corporations organized for the purpose\\nof religious worship. or for holding places of burial not for private profit, or\\nfor school purposes. or for purely public charity.\"\\nThe general objects and purposes of the Grand Lodge of I. 0. 0. F.. as ex-\\npressed in its charter, are \"for better providing the means nd associated effort\\nfor visiting the sick. reli g the distressed. burying the dead and educatingthe orphans. and for the better diffusion of the principles of benevolence and\\ncharity.\" Section 10 of the charter provides that it shall have power \"to estab-\\nlish, endow, superintend and control one or more manual labor. mechanical.\\nagricultural, scientific and classical colleges and univei-s.ities; also to insti-\\ntute. regulate and maintain houses for the widows and orphans of deceased Odd\\nFellows.\\nIt is apparent from the above that the general objects of the order are two-\\nfold. viz., charitable and edlucational. In so far as the establishment of schools\\nis concerned. there can be no question but that the same would be exempt under\\nthe very terms of section 7; but as to whether the practice-of charity and benev-\\nolence. visiting the sick and distressed. caring for. educating, and maintaining the\\nwidows and orphans of deceased Odd Fellows come within the meaning of the\\nterm \" purely public charity \" is a question not so. easy of solution. That the\\npractice of these commendable virtues is charitable there can be no question,but inasmuch as a portion of the dispensation of charity by the order is limited\\nto members of the ordea it is seriously contended that this eliminates the purely\\npublic features of the charity. and renders the institution subject to the payment\\nof the tax. This question has never been decided by the courts of this State, but\\nit has frequently been presented to and decided by the courts of other States, and\\nthe opinions widely differ; some holding that inasmuch as the dispensations of\\ncharity.by such orders are limited to the members of the orders and not open to\\nthe public, such institutions are not for \" purely public charity,\" while other\\ncourts hold that it is not necessary for the institutions to be open to the indeft-\\nnite public, but that if the institution is administered for charity, and not for\\nprivate profit or gain, this gives it the character of a \" purely publifc charity.\"\\nOne of the leading cases holding that such an institution is not for \"purely\\npublic charity\" is the case of Bangor v. Masonic Lodge. 73 Maine. It was there\\nheld that as the lodge was for the mutual benefit and protection, and the end to\\nbe attained private and personal. and its benefits confined to privileged persons\\nand not open to an indefinite public. it could not be considered for \" purely pub-\\nlic charity.\" This case is supported by a strong array of authorities on the same\\nline.\\nFrom the language used by the courts in deciding these cases. we infer that the\\ncharters of the institutions limited the right to dispense charity to members of\\nthe order.

On appeal. this view was at first sustained by the Su-\\npieme Court.\\nAfterwards, however, a rehearing was granted, and the former judgment was\\nreversed and a judgment entered in favor of the defendant, excepting its prop-\\nerty from taxation. In its final opinion the court, among other things, said:\\n\" It is conceded that the devise has created a charity which is in a sense public,\\nbut it is urgpd that it is not \" purely public.\" Now it must be conceded, and it\\nhas been decided, that the word 1, purely \\'\" is not to have its largest and broadest\\nsignificance when used in this connection. Without doubt an asylum for the\\nsupport of fifty blind men or an equal number of paupers would not be obnoxious\\nto the objection that it was not purely public. A charity for the maintenance\\nof disabled seamen or of aged and infirm stonemasons would undoubtedly be a\\npurely public charity, and so also would a charity for the education and main-\\ntenance of the children of such persons. and if such charity should be limited to\\nthe white female orphan children of such persons between the ages of four and\\neight years, such limitations, though they would greatly restrict the number and\\nclass of beneficiaries, would constitute no objection to the purely public char-\\nacter of the charity. Why, then, would not a charity for the support of poor\\nEpiscopalians. Catholics. Jews or Presbyterians of a State or city be a purely\\npublic charity ? No private gain or profit is subserved: the objects of such a\\ncharity are certain and definite, and the persons benefitted are indefinite within\\nthe specified class. The circumstance that the beneficiaries are to be of a parr\\nticular fa\\' h is only of importance as designating the class. As to the meaning\\nof the v d \" purely,\" when used in this connection. we concur in the construc-\\ntion g\\' by the Supreme Court of Ohio in the case of Gerke v. Purcell, 25 Ohio\\nState, tage 229; that is, \\'when the charity-is public, the exclusion of all idea of\\ngain or private profit is equivalent in effect to the forc4 of the word \" purely\"\\nas applied to \" public charity * in the Constitution.\\' \"\\nSee Burd Orphan Asylum v. School District. 90 Pa. St., 21.\\nAgain, the Supreme Court of Kentucky, in Zabet v. Louisville Baptist Orphan\\nHome. 17 :. W. Rep., page 212, says: \" It\\'is urged that the appellee renders no\\npublic service. and that therefore the Legislature could not constitutionally ex-\\nempt it from taxation.

It is the duty of the State to care for its indigent orphans, and if done by\\nanother. he renders what is properly a publiv, service, and the Legislature may,\\ntherefore. without regard to the extent of it, exempt the property devoted to\\nsuch use from taxation.\"\\nSo far as can be determined from the charter, constitution, and by-laws of the\\norder in question, it is wholly devoid of any idea of business profit or gain what-\\never.

Section 37 of article XVI of the Constitution reads:\\n\" Mechanics. artisans. and material men of every class shall have a lien upon the\\nbuildings and articles made or repaired by them for the value of their labor done\\nthereon, or materiais furnished therefor. and the Legislature shall provide for\\nthe speedy and efficient enforcement of said lien.\"\\nThe law enacted in pursuance of this section now reads, \"Any person or firm,lumber dealers, artisan, laborer, mechanic or sub-contractor. who may labor or\\nfurnish material * * * to erect any house or improvement. or to repair any\\nbuilding or improvement whatever, * * * shall have a lien on such house,buildings. fixtures or improvements. and shall also have a lien on the lot or lots\\nof land necessarily connected therewith.\" This law could not be construed so\\nas to give a lien upon structures such as railroads.\\nTyler Tap Railroad Company v. Driscol. 52 Texas, 13.\\nTherefore if contractors can retain any lien upon railroads, it must be by\\nvirtue of what is known as the \" railroad laborers\\' lien law.\"\\nSection 35, article XVI of the Constitution of 1876 provides: \" The Legisla-\\nture shall, at its first session. pass laws to protect laborers on public buildings.\\nstreets. roads, railroads. canals and other similar public works. against the failure\\nof contractors and sub-contractors to pay their current wages when due. and to\\nmake the corporation. company or individual for whose benefit the work is done,\\nresponsible for their ultimate payment.\"\\nIn pursuance of this section the Legislature of 1879 passed the following law:\\n-All mechanics, laborers and operatives who may have performed labor in the\\nconstruction or repair of any railroad locomotive, car or other equipment to a\\nrailroad. or who may have performed labor in the operating of a railroad, and\\nto whom wages are due and owing, shall hereafter have a lien prior to all others\\nupon such.railroad and its equipments for such wages as are unpaid.\" General\\nLaws.

Driscol, supra, --We think it manifest that this sec-\\ntion has no reference to contractors or builders, and the law enacted in pursu-\\nance of the section (that is the act of 1879 supra) shows that such is the view\\ntaken of it by the Legislature.\"\\nIn Texas and St. Louis R. R. v. Allen & Humphreys. 1 White and Wilson. sec-\\ntion 568 et seq., the question was raised whether the lien could be retained for\\nteams and tools furnished. The court held that the lien is restricted to personal\\nlabor, and does not embrace teams. tools, etc. In rendering the opinion this\\nlanguage is used: \"The object and purpose of this statute is to secure to me-\\nchanics, laborers. and operatives. and no others. wages due or owing to them for\\nwork and labor done and performed in constructing, repairing. or operating the\\nroad.

John H. Reagan, Chairman Railroad Commission, Austin.\\nDEAR SiR-Your inquiry relative to the repeal of article 4257 of the Revised\\nStatutes by the passage of the act to create the Railroad Commission of Texas,\\nhas been duly considered. Your question is substantially whether or not said\\narticle 4257, in so far as it establishes a maximum rate which may be charged by\\nrailroad companies., is repealed by the act establishing the Railroad Commission.\\nArticle 4257, in so far as it affects the question presented. reads as follows:\\nRailroad companies may charge and receive not exceeding the rate of fifty\\ncents per hundred pounds per hundred miles for the transportation of freight\\nover their roads: but the charges for transportation on each class of freight shall\\nbe uniform. and no unjust discrimination in the rates or charges for the trans-\\nportation of any freight shall be made against any person or place on any rail-\\nroad in this State.\"\\nThe act to establish the Railroad Commission of Texas is entitled \"An act to\\nestablish a Railroad Commission for the State of Texas, whereby discrimination\\nand extortion in railroad charges may be prevented, and reasonable freight and\\npassenger tariffs may be established.,\" etc. Section I establishes the Commission\\nand provides for the appointment of the Couimissioners. Section 2 provides for\\nthe organization of the Commission; and section 3 prescribes the authority and\\ndeclares the duty of the Commission. Subdivision \"a\" of said section confers\\npower upon the Commission to classify and subdivide all freight. and subdivision\\nb\" provides that \"the Commission shall have power and it shall be its duty to\\nfix to each class or subdivision of freight a reasonable rate for each railroad.\\nsubject to the act for the transportation of each of said classes and subdivisions.\"\\nSubdivision \"d\" provides that the Commission may fix different rates for differ-\\nent roads. Subdivision \\'e\" authorizes the Commission to fix rates for connect-ing lines of road. Subdivision \"h\" confers upon the Commissiob the power andduty from time to time to alter. change. amend. or abolish any classification orrate established br it when deemed necessary. Subdivision \\'j\" provides that the\\nCommission shall make reasonable and just rates of charges for each railroad for\\nthe transportation of loaded and empty cars. Section 23 of said act declares thatall laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act are hereby repealed.Under well settled rules of construction, where there is an express repeal of\\nall laws and parts of laws in contlict with an act passed, it is evident that in the\\nlegislative mind there were other laws existing in the State in conflict with theprovisions of the act to which the declaration of repeal is made. It shows there-\\'fore an intention to repeal, and is not in a strict legal sense merely a repeal byimplication.\\nSection 154 of Sutherland on Statutory Construction lays down the followingrule: \" Though a subsequent statute be not repugnant in all its provisions to aformer, yet if it was clearly intended to prescribe the only rule which shouldgovern, it repeals the former statute,\" and in section 155, id., it is said: \" Where\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', 'REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 90\\nthere are two acts on the same subject. and a later embraces all the provisions of\\nthe first and also new provisions, the later act operates without any repealing\\nclause, as a repeal of the first.\"\\nThese propositions are sustained by numerous authorities.\\nHarris v. Watson, 56 Ark., 574.\\nPublishing Co. v. Whitney, 32 Pac. Rep.. 237.\\nBryan v. Sunberg 5 Texas, 418.\\nThe State v. Stoll, 17 Wall!, 425.\\nUnited States v. Tinen, 11 Wall., 88.\\nFayette County v. Harris, 44 Texas, 514.\\nTracy v. Tuffy. 134 U. S., 206.\\nAuthorities might be multiplied indefinitely upon this proposition. It seems\\nto us to be clear that the-primary object of the act of April 3. 1891. referred to,\\nwas to confer upon the commission the power to fix reasonable rates. Hereto-\\nfore that power was vested in railroad companies, subject to the limitation pre-\\nscribed in article 4257, that the rates should not exceed fifty cents per hundred\\npounds per hundred miles. If it should be held that the maximum rate therein\\nprescribed was not repealed, it seems that it would follow that the converse of\\nthe proposition would be true, and that the railroads would still be authorized to\\ncharge fifty cents per hundred pounds per hundred miles. It is clear to our\\nminds that the act of April 3. 1891, intended to prescribe, and does prescribe,\\nthe only rule as to freight obtaining in this State, and that article 457, in so far\\nas it fixes the maximum freight rate, is in conflict with the act of April 3, 1891,\\nand is therefore to that extent repealed.\\nSt. Louis Ry. Co. v. Kay. 22 S. W. Rep., 685.\\nIn the last cited case the question was as to whether article 279 of the Revised\\nStatutes was repealed by the act of April 2, 1887. Article 279 refers to all car-\\nriers indiscriminately. The act of April 2. 1887, refers only to railroads. The\\ncourt say that in the case presented there is no necessary inconsistency or re-\\npugnancy between the two statutes. but \" it seems to us that the later statute\\nwas intended to cover the whole field as to railroad companies, and to lay down\\nthe only rule for a recovery against them for the particular wrong it points out.\\nFor these reasons we think article 279. in so far as it relates to railroad corpor-\\nations. is repealed by article 4227.\" (Act of April 2. 1887.)\\nWe believe that the act establishing the Railroad Commission \\'prescribes the\\nonly rule of regulation of freight rates, and that it was intended to cover the\\nwhole subject imatter, and it therefore repeals article 4257 as above indicated.\\nVery respectfully.\\n(Signed) FRANK ANDREWS,\\nOffice Assistant Attorney General.\\nTranscribing County Records.-County clerk is entitled to receive fifteen cents for\\ntranscribing old records of a county under article 4281 of the Revised Statutes.\\nATTORNEY GENERAL\\'S OFFICE,\\nAUSTIN, June 21, 1894.\\nG. P. Rogers, Esq., County Clerk, Refugio. Texas.\\nDEAR SIR-Your favor of June 16th. with its enclosure, received. We under-\\nstand the substance of the question propounded as follows: Under the order of\\nthe Commissioners Court you transcribed as county clerk one volume of the\\ncounty\\'s old record under the authority of article 4281 of the Revised Statutes.\\nThe question is, are you entitled to receive for this service fifteen cents pel hun-\\ndred words?\\nChapter 1 of title 85 of the Revised Statutes, which provides for the trans-\\ncribing of such records. does not expressly and specifically state the compensa-\\ntion to be received for such service. Chapter 99, General Laws 1879, which\\nprovides for the transcribing of records for newly organized counties, fixes the\\ncompensation of the clerk for such service at fifteen cents per hundred words.\\nThis is merely indicative of the legislative intention and expression of the legis-\\nlative mind upon the value of such work.\\nArticle 2393, Sayles\\' Statutes. fixes the fees of the county clerk, and two sub-\\ndivisions of that article might be said to bear upon the proposition stated. The\\nDigitized from Best Copy Available', '100 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL.\\ntitst reads: \" Copies of interrogatories. cross-interrogatories. and all other\\npapers or records required to be copied by him, including certificate and seal,when not otherwise provided for, each one hundred words, fifteen cents.\"\\nThe records transcribed are records which are required to be recorded by the\\ncounty clerk, and in our judgment the clerk is entitled to receive from the\\ncounty lifteen cents per one hundred words for making such record.\\nVery respectfully,\\n(Signed) FRANK ANDREWS.\\nOffice Assistant Attorney General.\\nCounty Attorny-Minor.-A minor. qIfter having his disabilities removed under\\narticlb 3361a.

Gustavus. -Madisonville, Texas.\\nDEAR Sim-In reply to your favor &f the 6th instant. wherein you ask if a\\nminor, after having his disabilities removed, is eligible to the office of county\\nattorney. I beg to say article 3361a, Sayles\\' Statutes, provides that after the re-\\nmoval of the disabilities of minority. said minor shall be deemed and held for\\nall legal purposes of full age. and shall be held responsible, and shall have all\\nthe privileges and advantages as if he were of full age. saving only that he shall\\nnot vote until he arrives at the age of twenty-one years. You will note that the\\nConstitution requires that a person shall be twenty-one years of age in order to\\nvote. but there is no such provision with reference to holding the office of county\\nattorney. Articles 249 and 251, Sayles\\' Statutes, provide that the county attor-\\nney shall be duly licensed to practice law in the District Courts of this State.\\nand shall reside in the county for which be was elected. There is no provision\\nof law nor clause in the Constitution which requires a county attorney to be\\ntwenty-one years old. This being the case, we conclude that after the removal\\nof the disabilities of a minor, and after he.hwelseen duly licensed to practice law\\nin the District Courts of this State, atrd\\'Isf idiident of the county, he is eligible\\nto the office of county attorney. , I\\nIn discussing this question our court used the following language: \" Eligi-\\nbility to oflice is not declared as a right or principle by any express terms of the\\nConstitution, but it rests as a just deduction from the express powers and pro-\\nvisions of the system. The basis of the principle is the absolute liberty of the\\nelectors and the appointing authorities to choose and appoint any person who is\\nnot made ineligible by the Constitution. Eligibility to office belongs, therefore,\\nnot exclusively or specially to electors enjoying the right of suffrage. It belongs\\nequally to all persons whomsoever not excluded by the Constitution. When a\\nConstitution has been framed which contains no provision defining in terms who\\nshall be eligible to office, there is strength in the argument that the intention was\\nto confide the selection to the untrammeled will of the electors. Experience\\nteaches us that in popular elections those only are chosen who are in sympathy\\nwith the people both in thought and aspiration.\"\\nSteusoff v.
