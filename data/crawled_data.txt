Branches of the U.S. government

Learn about the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the U.S. government. 

The Constitution of the United States divides the federal government into three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. This ensures that no individual or group will have too much power.

Legislative branch 

This branch is made up of (the Senate and House of Representatives) and special agencies and offices that provide support services to Congress.

The legislative branch’s roles include:

  * Drafting proposed laws
  * Confirming or rejecting presidential nominations for heads of federal agencies, federal judges, and the Supreme Court
  * Having the authority to declare war



Executive branch 

The executive branch’s key roles include:

  * President - The president is the head of state, leader of the federal government, and Commander in Chief of the United States armed forces. 
  * Vice president - The vice president supports the president. If the president is unable to serve, the vice president becomes president. The vice president also presides over the U.S. Senate and breaks ties in Senate votes.
  * The Cabinet - Cabinet members serve as advisors to the president. They include the vice president, heads of executive departments, and other high-ranking government officials. Cabinet members are nominated by the president and must be approved by the Senate.



The executive branch also includes executive departments, independent agencies, and other boards, commissions, and committees.

Judicial branch 

The judicial branch includes the and other federal courts.

It evaluates laws by:

  * Interpreting the meaning of laws
  * Applying laws to individual cases
  * Deciding if laws violate the Constitution



How each branch of government provides checks and balances

The ability of each branch to respond to the actions of the other branches is .

Each branch of government can change acts of the other branches:

  * The president can veto legislation created by Congress. He or she also nominates heads of federal agencies and high court appointees.
  * Congress confirms or rejects the president's nominees. It can also remove the president from office in exceptional circumstances.
  * The Justices of the Supreme Court, nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, can overturn unconstitutional laws.

USA.gov accessibility policy

Learn about USA.gov's commitment to accessibility and find tools to help you access government information and services. 

How USA.gov manages accessibility

USA.gov strives to make our website as accessible and usable as possible. We do this by following Section 508 and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) produced by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C, the web's governing body).

, as amended in 1998, is a federal law that requires government agencies to provide people with disabilities equal access to electronic information and data comparable to those who do not have disabilities.

WCAG is a set of checkpoints and guidelines that help ensure that websites are designed and written properly. For example:

  * Images have alternative text so if you can't see the image you can still read the text. 

  * Color contrast between the foreground and background is sufficiently strong. 

  * Text resizes according to user preference. 

  * Headings are correctly used and represent an accurate and logical outline of the content (they're not just ordinary text made to look big and bold). 

  * Links make sense by themselves (no links that say "click here" or "more..."). 

  * Tables are used for laying out tabular information and have proper headings and summaries. 

  * Lists items are defined as HTML bulleted lists to present items of equal status or value and as numbered lists if a particular order to the items is appropriate. 

  * The content is fully accessible and operable with keyboard navigation only. 




We aim for A and AA compliance across our site. We also look for opportunities to meet AAA compliance.

**Report a problem**

If you have a problem using our site, you can [report the issue to us online](/site-issue-report-form), or by calling us at 1-844-872-4681.

We will try to fix the issue, and we'll attempt to provide the information you're seeking in a format accessible to you.

**Where to find accessibility tools**

If you have any type of disability, we recommend that you visit the and the . You'll find expert advice such as alternative screen readers, screen magnifiers and other devices that can make using a computer easier and more enjoyable.

We also recommend that you visit , which provides advice on making your computer accessible.
