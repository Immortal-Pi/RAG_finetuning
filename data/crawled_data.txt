Check your federal or state tax refund status

If you expect a federal or state tax refund, you can track its status. Learn how and what information you will need. 

**Check your federal tax refund status**

Before checking on your refund, have the following ready:

  * Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)
  * Filing status
  * The exact whole dollar amount of your refund 



Use the IRS or the mobile app to check your refund online. This is the fastest and easiest way to track your refund. The systems are updated once every 24 hours.

You can [contact the IRS](/contact-irs) to check on the status of your refund. If you call, wait times to speak with a representative can be long. But you can avoid the wait by using the automated phone system. Follow the message prompts when you call.

**Find out when to expect your federal tax refund**

The IRS generally issues refunds within 21 days of when you electronically filed your tax return, and longer for paper returns.

Set up direct deposit to receive your tax refund

Get your tax refund faster through direct deposit instead of by mail. Learn how direct deposit works, how to set it up, and change your account’s information. 

**How to set up a direct deposit for your tax refund**

The IRS uses direct deposit to electronically issue tax refund payments directly into taxpayers’ financial accounts. In most cases, you will receive your tax refund in less than 21 days after you file your federal tax return. 

To get your refund deposited directly into your bank account, select the direct deposit option when prompted by the tax software you are using. Then, enter your account and routing numbers of the bank account you want your refund deposited into. 

, including:

  * How to request it if you are using a paper form 
  * What to do if you do not have a check to find your account and routing numbers
  * How to receive your refund through mobile apps and prepaid debit cards
  * How to have your refund deposited in up to 3 accounts
  * What to do if you do not have a bank account

**How to update your direct deposit information**

Every year you file your tax return, you must enter your direct deposit information to get your refund electronically. This information includes your bank information. 

If you enter your information incorrectly, you can call the IRS at 1-800-829-1040 to have it changed. This option only works if your refund has not yet been posted. 

If your refund has already been posted, .

Why your tax refund may be lower than expected

If you owe money to a federal or state agency, the federal government may use part or all of your federal tax refund to repay the debt. This is called a tax refund offset. 

If your tax refund is lower than you calculated, it may be due to a tax refund offset for an unpaid debt such as child support.

, including:

  * Why was my tax refund reduced?
  * How do I find out which federal or state agency requested the offset?
  * How do I correct an offset that was made in error?

Undelivered and unclaimed tax refund checks

Every year, millions of federal and state tax refunds go undelivered or unclaimed. Learn how to claim your refund if you did not file a return or if your check never got to you.

If you are eligible for a federal tax refund but do not file a return, your refund will go unclaimed. Even if you are not required to file a return, it might benefit you to file if:

How to pay and get help with state and local taxes

In many states, counties, and cities, you may have to pay taxes on income, property, and what you buy. Learn more about state taxes and who to contact if you need help. 

**Learn what state and local taxes you may have to pay**

  * **Income tax** - The amount of state and local income tax you pay will depend on how much income you earn and the tax rate of the state or locality where you live. Currently, 41 states collect income tax on salary and wages.
  * **Personal property tax** - You may have to pay taxes based on the value of your personal property. Personal property can include cars, boats, recreation vehicles, and business machinery. Not all states or local jurisdictions collect personal property taxes.
  * **Real estate tax** - In most cases, you will pay your real estate tax to your local government instead of your state government. Your local government’s tax office assesses the value of your home, and the amount you pay can depend on your home’s market value, location, and condition.
  * **Sales tax** - The sales tax you pay is based on a percentage of the sales price of an item you buy. Most states and municipalities have a sales tax and charge different percentages on different goods, or not at all for other items.

**Pay or get help with your state and local taxes**

To learn how much you owe, how to pay, when your return is due, information about refunds, and how to get tax relief:

  * [Find your local government’s website](https://www.usa.gov/local-governments) for information about county or city taxes
  *     * Use this chart to .



Your state and local government tax agencies can explain your rights as a taxpayer. Most also have a taxpayer advocate or ombudsman, who can help you with tax problems and complaints.

The amount of tax withheld from your pay depends on what you earn each pay period. It also depends on what information you gave your employer on Form W-4 when you started working. This information, like your filing status, can affect the tax rate used to calculate your withholding.

Since the exact amount that is withheld from your pay can change with each paycheck, the easiest way to figure out your tax withholding is by estimating it.

page to:

  * Know when to check your withholding
  * Use the withholding estimator tool to estimate your tax withholding

**Decide how much tax to withhold**

The more taxes you withhold from your pay, the less you may owe when your tax bill is due. But knowing when to increase or decrease the amount of taxes withheld from your paycheck can depend on:

  * How many jobs you have
  * If you have income from outside your job that is not subject to withholding
  * If you are eligible for income tax credits or deductions

**Change your tax withholding**

For federal tax withholding:

  * to your employer if you want to change the withholding from your regular pay.

Branches of the U.S. government

Learn about the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the U.S. government. 

The Constitution of the United States divides the federal government into three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. This ensures that no individual or group will have too much power.

Legislative branch 

This branch is made up of (the Senate and House of Representatives) and special agencies and offices that provide support services to Congress.

The legislative branch’s roles include:

  * Drafting proposed laws
  * Confirming or rejecting presidential nominations for heads of federal agencies, federal judges, and the Supreme Court
  * Having the authority to declare war



Executive branch 

The executive branch’s key roles include:

  * President - The president is the head of state, leader of the federal government, and Commander in Chief of the United States armed forces. 
  * Vice president - The vice president supports the president. If the president is unable to serve, the vice president becomes president. The vice president also presides over the U.S. Senate and breaks ties in Senate votes.
  * The Cabinet - Cabinet members serve as advisors to the president. They include the vice president, heads of executive departments, and other high-ranking government officials. Cabinet members are nominated by the president and must be approved by the Senate.



The executive branch also includes executive departments, independent agencies, and other boards, commissions, and committees.

Judicial branch 

The judicial branch includes the and other federal courts.

It evaluates laws by:

  * Interpreting the meaning of laws
  * Applying laws to individual cases
  * Deciding if laws violate the Constitution



How each branch of government provides checks and balances

The ability of each branch to respond to the actions of the other branches is .

Each branch of government can change acts of the other branches:

  * The president can veto legislation created by Congress. He or she also nominates heads of federal agencies and high court appointees.
  * Congress confirms or rejects the president's nominees. It can also remove the president from office in exceptional circumstances.
  * The Justices of the Supreme Court, nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, can overturn unconstitutional laws.

USA.gov privacy and security policies

USA.gov does not collect personal information when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information. 

**Federal government policy on web measurement and customization technologies**

The Office of Management and Budget in 2010 on how federal agencies can use web measurement and customization technologies. The guidance requires agencies to be open and transparent about using these technologies.

The guidance says agencies may not compromise or invade website visitors' personal privacy. Agencies can use cookies and other technologies to improve website visitors' experiences, and to see what is useful to the public and respond accordingly.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small text file that a website places on your web browser. Here is how USA.gov uses cookies:

  * We gather anonymous, statistical information about how people use USA.gov so we can improve our website. We use services to measure data about site activity. We only receive statistics on the traffic of the site as a whole and do not receive information related to a particular user.
  * We remember your browser when you return to our site, so we do not invite you to take our customer satisfaction survey again within 90 days of completing the survey.



Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. Although using cookies creates a much better experience for you, USA.gov will also work without them.

If you do not want to accept cookies, you can edit your browser's options to block cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. [Learn how to block cookies.](https://www.usa.gov/optout-instructions)

**External links**

USA.gov links to many websites created and maintained by other public and/or private organizations as outlined in our linking policy. If you click on a link to an outside website, you will leave the USA.gov site and are subject to the privacy and security policies of the owners/sponsors of the outside website.

**Social media sites**

USA.gov manages a presence on social media sites such as , , , , and others to share government information and engage with the public. We do not collect any personally identifiable information through those sites, and we do not use personal information made available by the third-party sites.

**If you send us personal information**

We do not collect personal information for any purpose other than to respond to your request. The only personal information that we collect is what you decide to give us by .

We only share the information you give us with another government agency if your question relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. USA.gov never collects information or creates individual profiles for commercial marketing.

USA.gov accessibility policy

Learn about USA.gov's commitment to accessibility and find tools to help you access government information and services. 

How USA.gov manages accessibility

USA.gov strives to make our website as accessible and usable as possible. We do this by following Section 508 and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) produced by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C, the web's governing body).

, as amended in 1998, is a federal law that requires government agencies to provide people with disabilities equal access to electronic information and data comparable to those who do not have disabilities.

WCAG is a set of checkpoints and guidelines that help ensure that websites are designed and written properly. For example:

  * Images have alternative text so if you can't see the image you can still read the text. 

  * Color contrast between the foreground and background is sufficiently strong. 

  * Text resizes according to user preference. 

  * Headings are correctly used and represent an accurate and logical outline of the content (they're not just ordinary text made to look big and bold). 

  * Links make sense by themselves (no links that say "click here" or "more..."). 

  * Tables are used for laying out tabular information and have proper headings and summaries. 

  * Lists items are defined as HTML bulleted lists to present items of equal status or value and as numbered lists if a particular order to the items is appropriate. 

  * The content is fully accessible and operable with keyboard navigation only. 




We aim for A and AA compliance across our site. We also look for opportunities to meet AAA compliance.

**Report a problem**

If you have a problem using our site, you can [report the issue to us online](/site-issue-report-form), or by calling us at 1-844-872-4681.

We will try to fix the issue, and we'll attempt to provide the information you're seeking in a format accessible to you.

**Where to find accessibility tools**

If you have any type of disability, we recommend that you visit the and the . You'll find expert advice such as alternative screen readers, screen magnifiers and other devices that can make using a computer easier and more enjoyable.

We also recommend that you visit , which provides advice on making your computer accessible.
