Driving in the U.S. if you are not a citizen

Depending on the U.S. states you will visit, you may need an International Driving Permit (IDP) as well as a driver's license your country. 

**Learn about IDPs and how to get one before you visit the U.S.**

An IDP is a form of identification that many countries around the world recognize. It allows you to drive legally in a different country.

  * Not every U.S. state requires an IDP. Contact the [state department of motor vehicles](/state-motor-vehicle-services) for each state you plan to drive in to see if they require an IDP.
  * You must get an IDP before your trip. The U.S. does not issue IDPs to foreign visitors.
  * To get an IDP, contact the motor vehicle department of the country that issued your driver's license. The fees and amount of time it will take to receive your IDP will depend on the issuing country.
  * You may need both your license and an IDP to rent a car in the U.S. Check the rental company's policies and other requirements in advance.

**Driver's licenses if you are living in the U.S. as a permanent resident**

If you are a citizen of another country and are living permanently in the U.S., you may be eligible to apply for a driver's license from the state where you live.

  * The residency requirement for obtaining a U.S. driver's license is different in each state.
  * Contact your [state department of motor vehicles](/state-motor-vehicle-services) to check the ID requirements and find out how to apply for a license.
  * A state driver's license allows you to drive anywhere in the U.S.

Driving in the U.S. if you are not a citizen

Depending on the U.S. states you will visit, you may need an International Driving Permit (IDP) as well as a driver's license your country. 

**Learn about IDPs and how to get one before you visit the U.S.**

An IDP is a form of identification that many countries around the world recognize. It allows you to drive legally in a different country.

  * Not every U.S. state requires an IDP. Contact the [state department of motor vehicles](/state-motor-vehicle-services) for each state you plan to drive in to see if they require an IDP.
  * You must get an IDP before your trip. The U.S. does not issue IDPs to foreign visitors.
  * To get an IDP, contact the motor vehicle department of the country that issued your driver's license. The fees and amount of time it will take to receive your IDP will depend on the issuing country.
  * You may need both your license and an IDP to rent a car in the U.S. Check the rental company's policies and other requirements in advance.

**Driver's licenses if you are living in the U.S. as a permanent resident**

If you are a citizen of another country and are living permanently in the U.S., you may be eligible to apply for a driver's license from the state where you live.

  * The residency requirement for obtaining a U.S. driver's license is different in each state.
  * Contact your [state department of motor vehicles](/state-motor-vehicle-services) to check the ID requirements and find out how to apply for a license.
  * A state driver's license allows you to drive anywhere in the U.S.

Conducir en EE. UU. con licencia del extranjero

En Estados Unidos los requisitos para manejar dependen de la ley de cada estado; en algunos, exigen un Permiso de Conducir Internacional (IDP, sigla en inglés) y la licencia de su país. Averigüe qué se necesita para conducir en EE. UU. como extranjero. 

**Qué es el Permiso de Conducir Internacional**

Un IDP es una forma de identificación que muchos países del mundo reconocen para conducir legalmente en un país diferente al suyo. También se conoce como licencia de conducir internacional.

En EE. UU. no todos los estados requieren una licencia internacional. Para saber si necesita un IDP, usted debe [verificar en el departamento de vehículos motorizados de cada estado donde va a conducir (en inglés)](https://www.usa.gov/state-motor-vehicle-services).

**Cómo sacar un permiso o licencia de conducir internacional**

El Permiso de Conducir Internacional debe obtenerlo antes de su viaje, en el país que emitió su licencia de conducir. En EE. UU. no se emiten IDP a visitantes extranjeros.

También, consulte las normas y requisitos de las compañías de alquiler de autos de EE. UU. con anticipación. Algunas exigen la licencia y el IDP.

**¿Un extranjero residente permanente puede sacar una licencia de conducir en Estados Unidos?**

Un ciudadano de otro país que vive permanentemente en EE. UU., podría obtener una licencia de conducir estatal.

En este caso, si usted vive en EE. UU. como residente permanente, puede solicitar una licencia de conducir del estado donde reside.

La licencia de conducir estatal le permite manejar en cualquier lugar de EE. UU. Tenga en cuenta lo siguiente:

  * Cada estado tiene exigencias particulares para determinar, si usted es un residente del estado y puede obtener una licencia de conducir.
  * Cada estado tiene requisitos de identificación que los solicitantes deben cumplir.



[Comuníquese con el departamento de vehículos motorizados de su estado (en inglés)](https://www.usa.gov/state-motor-vehicle-services), y verifique qué se necesita para sacar una licencia como extranjero residente permanente.

International travel documents for children

See what documents a child needs to travel to or from the U.S. alone or with a parent or relative. 

Non-U.S. citizen children traveling to the U.S.

Additionally, if the child is traveling alone, with only one of their custodial parents, or with a guardian to the U.S., they should have:

  * Documents that their country requires for children traveling outside their country without both parents
    * Each country has its own rules for the specific documents it requires for a child to be allowed to leave their home country without both of their custodial parents or with a guardian. Contact to find out what specific documents the country requires to allow the child to leave their country.
  * A letter of consent, preferably in English and notarized, from the other parent or signed by both custodial parents. 
    * The letter should say: "I acknowledge that my child is traveling outside the country with [the name of the adult] with my permission."
    * A parent who frequently crosses the border by land with a minor should always carry a letter of permission from the other parent.
    * A parent with sole custody of the child they are traveling with should carry a copy of the custody document.



If your child is traveling alone by air, the airline may require you to submit an unaccompanied minor form and pay a fee for unaccompanied minor service. This service provides an airline employee escort for your child at the airport and on board the plane. In addition, you and the person picking your child up at their destination may also need to provide the airline with identification and contact information.

Contact your airline before your child’s trip to find out:

  * What age requirements the airline has for their unaccompanied minor service
  * If you can book a ticket with a connecting flight
  * What documents and fees are required

Additionally, if a minor is traveling abroad alone:

  * and ask about entry and exit requirements for that country.
  * The airline may require you to submit an unaccompanied minor form and pay them a fee for unaccompanied minor service. This service provides an airline employee escort for your child at the airport and on board the plane. In addition, you and the person picking your child up at their destination may also need to provide the airline with identification and contact information.
    * Contact your airline before your child’s trip to find out:
      * What age requirements the airline has for their unaccompanied minor service

Branches of the U.S. government

Learn about the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the U.S. government. 

The Constitution of the United States divides the federal government into three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. This ensures that no individual or group will have too much power.

Legislative branch 

This branch is made up of (the Senate and House of Representatives) and special agencies and offices that provide support services to Congress.

The legislative branch’s roles include:

  * Drafting proposed laws
  * Confirming or rejecting presidential nominations for heads of federal agencies, federal judges, and the Supreme Court
  * Having the authority to declare war



Executive branch 

The executive branch’s key roles include:

  * President - The president is the head of state, leader of the federal government, and Commander in Chief of the United States armed forces. 
  * Vice president - The vice president supports the president. If the president is unable to serve, the vice president becomes president. The vice president also presides over the U.S. Senate and breaks ties in Senate votes.
  * The Cabinet - Cabinet members serve as advisors to the president. They include the vice president, heads of executive departments, and other high-ranking government officials. Cabinet members are nominated by the president and must be approved by the Senate.



The executive branch also includes executive departments, independent agencies, and other boards, commissions, and committees.

Judicial branch 

The judicial branch includes the and other federal courts.

It evaluates laws by:

  * Interpreting the meaning of laws
  * Applying laws to individual cases
  * Deciding if laws violate the Constitution



How each branch of government provides checks and balances

The ability of each branch to respond to the actions of the other branches is .

Each branch of government can change acts of the other branches:

  * The president can veto legislation created by Congress. He or she also nominates heads of federal agencies and high court appointees.
  * Congress confirms or rejects the president's nominees. It can also remove the president from office in exceptional circumstances.
  * The Justices of the Supreme Court, nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, can overturn unconstitutional laws.

USA.gov accessibility policy

Learn about USA.gov's commitment to accessibility and find tools to help you access government information and services. 

How USA.gov manages accessibility

USA.gov strives to make our website as accessible and usable as possible. We do this by following Section 508 and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) produced by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C, the web's governing body).

, as amended in 1998, is a federal law that requires government agencies to provide people with disabilities equal access to electronic information and data comparable to those who do not have disabilities.

WCAG is a set of checkpoints and guidelines that help ensure that websites are designed and written properly. For example:

  * Images have alternative text so if you can't see the image you can still read the text. 

  * Color contrast between the foreground and background is sufficiently strong. 

  * Text resizes according to user preference. 

  * Headings are correctly used and represent an accurate and logical outline of the content (they're not just ordinary text made to look big and bold). 

  * Links make sense by themselves (no links that say "click here" or "more..."). 

  * Tables are used for laying out tabular information and have proper headings and summaries. 

  * Lists items are defined as HTML bulleted lists to present items of equal status or value and as numbered lists if a particular order to the items is appropriate. 

  * The content is fully accessible and operable with keyboard navigation only. 




We aim for A and AA compliance across our site. We also look for opportunities to meet AAA compliance.

**Report a problem**

If you have a problem using our site, you can [report the issue to us online](/site-issue-report-form), or by calling us at 1-844-872-4681.

We will try to fix the issue, and we'll attempt to provide the information you're seeking in a format accessible to you.

**Where to find accessibility tools**

If you have any type of disability, we recommend that you visit the and the . You'll find expert advice such as alternative screen readers, screen magnifiers and other devices that can make using a computer easier and more enjoyable.

We also recommend that you visit , which provides advice on making your computer accessible.
