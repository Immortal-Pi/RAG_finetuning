[Create a Library Account Online](/about-us/get-a-library-account/library-account-registration/ "Create a Library Account Online")

Please note that we do not take requests for renewals over the phone or through e-mail.

I just filled out the renewal form. Why can't I access my account?

From the Western Frontier to the Digital Frontier: A History of the State Law Library

Director Amy Small researched and compiled this article for the . It originally appeared in .

> “[A] lawyer without books would be like a workman without tools.”[[1]](#fn1)– Thomas Jefferson

1840–1892: The Early Years

During the Republic of Texas and the early days of statehood, legal materials were scarce. Public law libraries were unheard of and practitioners primarily depended on private collections. While some private collections were dazzling in scope, such as John Hemphill’s 2,400-volume collection,[[2]](#fn2) even the collections of respected and successful lawyers were more often meager holdings of fewer than 100 books.[[3]](#fn3) In one astonishing case, the chief justice of Brazoria County opted to spend “considerable sums on clothes and liquor” and owned only two law books at the time of his death.[[4]](#fn4) Even if they owned numerous books, frontier attorneys and judges were in practice limited to the number of books that they could stuff into their saddlebags.[[5]](#fn5)

The paucity of Republic-era law libraries may have been as much due to the difficulty of having books delivered and distributed as it was to the relatively small number of legal publishers. In a letter to a friend, Chief Justice John Hemphill related a book-delivery mishap worthy of the Wild West: “These books were landed at Linnville and from thence carried off by the Indians in their late incursion. They were recaptured afterward on the Plumb Creek Battleground and most of them sent to Victoria.”[[6]](#fn6) The books in question, a volume of the United States Supreme Court Reports and an English summary of Spanish law, suffered considerably before making their way back to the judge. The books were “strung to the Indians’ saddles by strings run through the volumes.”[[7]](#fn7) The book thieves forced a woman captured in the same heist to read aloud from the volumes for their amusement, which caused an observer to declare that “[d]eath would have been preferable.”[[8]](#fn8) Once all parties tired of that, several pages were torn out and used as cigarette rolling papers.[[9]](#fn9)

Whatever the cause, the scarcity of legal materials is reflected in the quality of the scholarship in legal opinions of the time. Chief Justice Thomas J. Rusk’s opinions from 1840, collected in Dallam’s Reports, did not cite any legal authorities whatsoever. In _The History of the Supreme Court of the State of Texas,_ J. H. Davenport posits that this could be due to the fact that “in the infancy of the Republic there were practically no authorities accessible to the court,” rather than a lack of “great learning” on Chief Justice Rusk’s part, as a contemporaneous biographer suggested.[[10]](#fn10) Other opinions from this time period explicitly lament the lack of access to legal resources. Several of Chief Justice Hemphill’s opinions qualify his decisions due to “the want of authorities.”[[11]](#fn11) In one case, _Republic v. Dewees,_ the Court declined to rule on a point of law entirely because they felt they could not properly consider it “without Books and the assistance of counsel.”[[12]](#fn12)

The was formally established in 1846 without an accompanying library or devoted research materials.[[13]](#fn13) The new Supreme Court justices surely must have been plagued by the same problems that justices in the Republic of Texas faced because in 1849 Attorney General John W. Harris delivered a report to Governor George T. Wood containing an impassioned plea for the acquisition of a law library. Harris recognized the danger that inadequate legal resources posed to the fledgling body of civil law in Texas.

> The system which is being formed by the decisions of our Supreme Court, when tested by the legal lights of other states and countries may be found (in many important particulars,) at variance with some of the longest established principles of the law.[[14]](#fn14)

Creating and perpetuating a body of law based on faulty legal fundamentals, he warned, endangered “thousands of innocent citizens.”[[15]](#fn15) He urged immediate action to supply the Supreme Court with materials so that the Court could adjudicate correctly from that point forward. “Remedies come too late when the mischief has already been done.”[[16]](#fn16)

His request did not fall on deaf ears. The following year, the issued a joint resolution granting the Supreme Court an appropriation of $100 “for the purchase of thirteen volumes of a collection of the laws, decrees, edicts, regulations, etc.”[[17]](#fn17) Four short years later, in 1854, the Legislature transferred the collection of law books to the Supreme Court and appropriated the eye-popping sum of $15,000 for the purchase of books.[[18]](#fn18)

To put the size of that budget and its purchasing power into perspective, the private law library of New Orleans attorney Henry Adams Bullard was auctioned in 1851, bringing in $362.91 for the 411 volumes in the collection.[[19]](#fn19) Fifteen thousand dollars was enough to procure a world-class law library.

The responsibility for purchasing material for the Library of the Supreme Court rested with the Chief Justice. At the time of this windfall, that position was held by John Hemphill, owner of the fabulously extensive legal collection referenced above. Chief Justice Hemphill’s involvement in the development of early Texas law cannot be overstated. As a legal scholar, he had a particular passion for Spanish and Mexican law. He was conversant in Spanish and helped to incorporate concepts from Spanish law, such as homestead exemptions and community property, into the .[[20]](#fn2) His interest in Spanish civil law is reflected in the purchases of this era; a Supreme Court Library catalog from 1880 shows that Spanish law titles make up a third of the civil law collection and were all purchased prior to Hemphill’s departure from the Court in 1858.[[21]](#fn21)

From this point, the Supreme Court Library began to take shape with new guidelines issued from the Legislature every few years. Beginning in 1860, the Secretary of State was required to furnish all three branch libraries of the Supreme Court with sufficient copies of case reports, statutes, and digests so that the individual judges plus every branch library would receive a complete set of each. In 1864, the clerk of the Court was mandated to be the librarian, responsible for “keeping and preserving the books of the Supreme Court.”[[22]](#fn22) The duties of the clerk/librarian were further expanded in 1866 to include the creation of catalogs of the libraries’ books. The 1866 bill also required that the libraries be open to public use.[[23]](#fn23) The lack of any other law libraries open to the public in the area meant that local attorneys and law students often stopped in to discuss and debate, creating a convivial environment for the keen legal minds of the time.

By 1882, these developments had transformed the Supreme Court Library from a nonentity to a celebrated collection of “all the learning—continental, English, and American.”[[24]](#fn24)

1892–1959: Stretched Thin

In 1892, the Galveston and Tyler branches of the Supreme Court and its libraries were disbanded by the Legislature, and the Court settled into its permanent home in Austin.[[25]](#fn25) The contents of the now-defunct branches were consolidated into one Supreme Court Library, which was housed in the north wing of the newly constructed . The Supreme Court Library and the Texas State Library shared a beautiful space which is now home to the .

[![Image of the Supreme Court Library ca. 1897, a large room with high ceilings supported by columns, and containing large wooden desks and bookcases.](/media/44084/supreme-court-library-circa-1897-small.jpg)](/media/44062/supreme-court-library-circa-1897-large.jpg "Click to enlarge") “Supreme Court Library,” ca. 1897. Smoot-Graham Papers, Briscoe Center for American History.

After the succession of legislation that formalized the Supreme Court Library in the 1860s, the Library remained mostly untouched by the Legislature until the 1950s. The Library did not receive any further large infusions of money, and its day-to-day operations were left in the capable hands of its librarian, Lawrence K. Smoot. Although the clerk of the Supreme Court was statutorily designated as the librarian, then-clerk Dr. Charles S. Morse decided that he much preferred to hire someone to serve as a librarian to manage the Court Library. Morse hired Smoot as a librarian in 1896, marking the beginning of a long career with the Supreme Court. In a 2011 Senate Resolution honoring his daughter, Jane Smoot, he was recognized as the longest-tenured state employee ever, with sixty-six years of service to the state.[[26]](#fn26) The one major instance in which the Legislature meddled with Library operations came in the 1907 legislative session. The adopted a resolution to keep the Supreme Court Library open from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., seven days a week, with a mere pittance appropriated for “additional help."[[27]](#fn27) Ever dedicated, Smoot manned the Library day and night by himself for months, straining his health to the point that he needed an entire year to recover.

Smoot recalls the general disorder that greeted him in his early days on the job. “The judges would send a porter to the library to locate a book. If the book was missing, the porter would just bring the book next to the one that was missing.”[[28]](#fn28) This lackadaisical attitude towards library resources can be seen in photographs of the Capitol basement around the turn of the century. Books are piled on the ground, spilling into disorderly heaps of haphazard pages.

A constitutional amendment adopted in 1945 increased the number of Supreme Court justices from three to nine.[[29]](#fn29) The newly tripled Court, plus the additional support staff, placed further strain on library resources. The number of library staff did not increase proportionally, stretching the one librarian and one porter that the Legislature allotted to the Supreme Court even thinner. By the 1950s, stagnant funding and suffocating overcrowding in the Capitol had taken its toll on the Supreme Court Library. Books and records were stored in disarray in barns in north Austin, literally piled to the rafters.[[30]](#fn30) The justices’ offices were separated into two groups on the third and fourth floors of the Capitol, while the library itself was inconveniently still located on the second floor.[[31]](#fn31) The library collection was scattered throughout hallways, with a makeshift “huddle room” on the third floor. Valuable volumes had to be kept in secure locations to protect them from theft,[[32]](#fn32) possibly by attorneys who feared never being able to find a specific book again if they returned it.[[33]](#fn33) In this state, the library was all but useless, and in fact was rarely used by members of the Court. Justice Joe Greenhill recalls that he “certainly never checked out a book”[[34]](#fn34) from the “poor excuse for a library.”[[35]](#fn35)

Recognizing the desperate need for adequate facilities, Representative Bill Daniel led a charge in the Legislature for the construction of additional buildings in the Capitol area to house the Courts, the State Library, and the . His initial attempts were not successful, but Representative Daniel was undeterred, and a constitutional amendment approving the use of Confederate pension funds for a new Supreme Court Building was finally approved by voters six years later in 1954.[[36]](#fn36) The was completed in 1959.

While the new building temporarily gave the Library some much-needed space, it did not address any of the deeper problems the library was facing. The Legislature had neglected to appropriate money for any furniture or additional staff for the new library. Frances Horton, the long-suffering librarian since 1947, soldiered on with only a porter to assist her with book repairs and shelving. She regularly exhausted her book budget partway through the year and had no funds for treatises or textbooks.[[37]](#fn37)

The beleaguered Library found a champion in Jack Pope upon his election to the Supreme Court in 1964. Justice Pope found the Library to be sorely lacking compared to the Bexar County Law Library at his previous post as Justice in San Antonio. Upon joining the high court, he expressed shock that everyone seemed satisfied with such a poorly-maintained library. His dismay prompted Chief Justice Robert Calvert to ask him to assume administrative oversight of the Library in 1969. Justice Pope immediately got to work and took his concerns directly to the Legislature. He recalled a particularly effective appearance before the Senate Committee in his interview in _A Texas Supreme Court Trilogy:_

[![Image of the Supreme Court Library in the basement of the Capitol, ca. 1909, a basement room with overflowing shelves and leaning piles of books stacked haphazardly on desks and the floor.](/media/44080/library-in-capitol-basement-circa-1909-small.jpg)](/media/44079/library-in-capitol-basement-circa-1909-large.jpg "Click to enlarge") Supreme Court Library in the basement of the Capitol, ca. 1909, image 1/103-127.

> I asked Chief Justice Calvert if he would consent to my appearing before the Senate Committee to request funds, and he heartily agreed. I appeared and displayed to the Committee a textbook published in 1920 by Professor Cooley. I told the Committee that I was showing them the most recent work in the Supreme Court Library about constitutional law and that most law firms in Texas had more recent and scholarly materials than the Texas Supreme Court.[[38]](#fn38)

Justice Pope worked closely with Frances Horton to develop a plan to improve the Library’s standing. A critical component of this plan was the solicitation of evaluations of the Library’s collection and staff from local professional librarians. Horton and Pope reached out to Alfred J. Coco, law librarian at the Bates School of Law at the ; Professor Roy Mersky from the at the School of Law; and Dr. Dorman Winfrey and Lee Brawner of the , for their expertise. To no one’s surprise, the evaluations found that the Library was “in desperate need of additional staff” and that the budget was “wholly inadequate” to maintain a collection that had value but was sadly neglected.[[39]](#fn39)

Thinking that bringing the Library out from under the shadows of the Supreme Court might improve its standing, Justice Pope and John Onion, Presiding Judge of the Court of Criminal Appeals, asked State Senator Jack Hightower and Representative Don Cavness to sponsor a bill changing the name of the Supreme Court Library to the State Law Library. The critical shortcomings described in the Library evaluations spurred the Legislature to act, and the bill sailed through both chambers without a single dissenting vote.[[40]](#fn40) The legislation also had the purpose of expanding the Library’s patron base to include citizens of the state.

On June 8, 1971, Governor John Connally, once a part-time employee in the Supreme Court Library,[[41]](#fn41) signed the bill creating the [State Law Library](https://www.sll.texas.gov/ "State Law Library") as an independent agency.

1971–2004: A New Beginning

The first order of business for the new agency was to get the Library’s collection back into shape. To do so, the Library needed three things: more staff, a systematic analysis of what the collection had and what it lacked, and funding.

[![Image of the first State Law Library board, composed of four members. Three members are pictured standing and the fourth sitting in front of a bookcase of legal volumes.](/media/44070/first-sll-board-small.jpg)](/media/44069/first-sll-board-large.jpg "Click to enlarge") First State Law Library Board: standing, Judge Wendell Odom, Justice Jack Pope, and Alfred Walker; seated, Marian Boner, Director of the State Law Library. Reprinted with permission from the September 1972 issue of the _Texas Bar Journal._

The newly formed Board of Directors, consisting of Justice Jack Pope from the Supreme Court, Judge Wendell Odom from the Court of Criminal Appeals, and Alfred Walker from the Office of the Attorney General, approved the hire of Jane Olm as Assistant Librarian. Olm brought to the job four years of experience at the University of Texas’s Tarlton Law Library and a master’s degree, making her the first professionally trained librarian in the Library’s history. She also brought her personal electric typewriter. As of 1968, the new Library had no catalog[[42]](#fn42) and the staff had no real grasp of what the collection contained, presenting obvious problems for Library patrons. Jane Olm and her typewriter set to work on the necessary but monumental task of creating a card catalog from scratch. In addition to solving basic usability problems, a complete catalog would allow the staff to identify areas of the collection that needed development and to submit targeted requests for funding to the Legislature.

As far as funding, the development of the state budget for the 1972–73 biennium was taking place at the same time that the bill establishing the State Law Library as a separate agency was moving through the Legislature. The initial appropriations bill granted the Supreme Court $20,000 per year for the operation of the Law Library in 1972 and 1973.[[43]](#fn43) Governor Preston Smith vetoed the entirety of the 1973 appropriations,[[44]](#fn44) causing this portion of the budget discussions to be deferred to a special session that would not start for a full year. Justice Pope seized upon this extra time and again came to the Library’s rescue. His advocacy to the Legislature resulted in a total of $106,173 being set aside from the budgets of the Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeals, and the Office of the Attorney General for the operation of the State Law Library in the 1973 fiscal year.[[45]](#fn45) This huge increase in budget, along with a $30,538 grant from the Criminal Justice Council, permitted the Library to purchase six hundred new titles and fill gaps in the collection that had accrued over time.

Frances Horton retired in February of 1972, concluding twenty-five years as the steadfast if often underappreciated law librarian for the State of Texas. The Library’s Board offered the Director position to Marian Boner, who readily accepted. Boner was an attorney, Associate Professor at the University of Texas School of Law, Reference Librarian at Tarlton Law Library, and according to Jane Olm, “a bundle of energy” and a “tireless legal scholar.”[[46]](#fn46)

Boner’s enthusiasm was apparent in the incredible headway Library staff made in her first two years as Director. The Library hired two additional librarians, a cataloger, and an acquisitions librarian, doubling the size of the professional staff almost overnight. The collection was carefully evaluated and more than 9,000 out-of-date or duplicate volumes were discarded or sold.[[47]](#fn47) She acquired modern equipment, such as electric typewriters, an ultrafiche reader/printer, a coin-operated Xerox machine, and an electric adding machine, for the use of staff and patrons. The Library extended its hours to remain open in the evenings. The Library also took on the responsibility of assisting incarcerated Texans with locating copies of their case files, a huge task that formerly fell to the . During this era, Boner somehow also managed to find the time to write _A Reference Guide to Texas Law and Legal History: Sources and Documentation,_ a thoroughly researched overview of the evolution of Texas’s legal framework and relevant resources.

Boner made concerted efforts to increase awareness of the Library’s new and improved services and collection. She published an update on the Library’s progress in the in 1976, explaining what the newly established agency had to offer and emphasizing its utility to practicing attorneys. She urged attorneys from all across Texas to visit the Library to “get acquainted with its collection.”[[48]](#fn48)

The net effect of many of the changes that Boner implemented was to transform the Library from a mere collection of books to a research facility that was managed by professionals. The librarians she hired had been educated in the most effective ways to match patrons with the information they were seeking, which heightened the services that patrons could expect to receive. She and her two successors, Jim Hambleton and Kay Schlueter, were all active in regional and national law librarian organizations. They held leadership roles in these organizations and spoke at conferences, raising the profile of the Library as a truly professional entity.

Jim Hambleton succeeded Marian Boner as Director in 1981. Like Boner, Hambleton was an attorney and former Head of Public Services at UT’s Tarlton Law Library. Hambleton’s primary professional interests were exploring the quirks of Texas law and considering how attorneys and librarians could use new computing technology to improve access to information. In 1983, he correctly predicted that “[t]he day will arrive when most attorneys do their legal research at a terminal beside their desk, at a considerable saving of time and with greater accuracy than presently.”[[49]](#fn49) As Director of the State Law Library, he did his part to encourage the legal community to embrace computers. His direction set an enduring precedent in the Library: it would adopt cutting-edge technology that would allow patrons to conduct more efficient and effective research. In 1984, the very first year that personal computers were available through a state purchasing contract, Hambleton bought two for the Library.[[50]](#fn50) It was also during his tenure as Director that the Library acquired Westlaw and Dialog terminals.

Hambleton was also an enthusiastic and prolific author. During his time as Director, he published frequently, mostly in the _Texas Bar Journal,_ as author or co-author of over twenty articles from 1982 to 1985. He had a keen mind for discussing aspects of legal research that would interest and affect practicing attorneys. As a representative of the State Law Library, his constant presence in legal periodicals reflected well on the Library as a serious and professional center of legal thought. He, along with librarian Karl Gruben, edited the second edition of Marian Boner’s _Reference Guide to Texas Law and Legal History._

The Library’s success in recreating itself as a relevant and vital member of the legal community was tempered by the fact that it was once again housed in inadequate and crumbling facilities. The Supreme Court Building housing the Library was showing its age. The building itself was falling apart and staff and patrons were regularly startled by exploding fluorescent light fixtures.[[51]](#fn51) An outdated electrical system and asbestos ceiling posed additional hazards.[[52]](#fn52) The Library was bursting at the seams with hundreds of new titles and no amount of conversion to microfiche alleviated the need for more space. In time, the Library even ran out of room for microfiche storage.

To address these concerns, the Legislature authorized the construction of the Price Daniel Building and the renovation of the Supreme Court Building with new library space in 1985. By the time construction broke ground in May of 1991, Kay Schlueter had risen to the role of Director. The renovations required the relocation of the books and equipment that the Library had so carefully acquired in recent years. The temporary location in the new Price Daniel Building was not large enough to accommodate the 110,000 to 120,000 volumes the Library now owned, and so the majority of the collection was housed in a makeshift storage area in a parking garage. The garage was plagued with problems: horrendous smells, fluctuating temperatures, and mosquitoes.[[53]](#fn53) Worst of all, patrons were frustrated by their inability to access over half of the Library’s collection. Library staff suffered these professional indignities for two years, bringing to mind the disjointed and chaotic conditions that the Supreme Court Library endured in the 1950s.

In another stroke of misfortune reminiscent of the mid-century move from the Capitol to the Supreme Court Building, the Legislature yet again did not provide funding for furniture for the new space. Kay Schlueter rallied supporters of the Library to form the Friends of the State Law Library, known as FOSLL. FOSLL organized a fundraising effort whereby donors could honor loved ones by etching their names on brass dedicatory plaques on the chairs and tables that their donations made possible. In Schlueter’s own words:

[![Image of library collections stored in a parking garage, ca. 1991, a cramped space storing volumes, furniture, and other equipment and secured with a chainlink gated fence.](/media/44082/library-in-garage-circa-1991-small.jpg)](/media/44081/library-in-garage-circa-1991-large.jpg "Click to enlarge") Library collection housed in a parking garage, ca. 1991.

> When planning our renovated space and moving back into our building several years ago, we wanted to find a way to make this more than just another state office building. We wanted to recapture the warmth of our old surroundings and to have some obvious ties to the history and development of our legal system. We couldn't think of a more appropriate way of doing this than recognizing the men and women who have shaped our system through the years.[[54]](#fn54)

These pieces of furniture remain a lovely feature of the Library even today, and the occasional visits by donors and their families to see their chairs continue to delight the staff.

When not enduring the horrors of the parking garage workspace, Schlueter’s focus as Director was to continue Marian Boner’s outreach efforts to the legal community. Schlueter assembled a strong network of Library advocates and volunteers. The Library regularly drew more than 1,000 volunteer hours per year. Volunteers lightened the burden of clerical work and created the Library’s first website. FOSLL grew into a fundraising powerhouse, capable of raising donations equal to about 25 percent of the Library’s annual appropriations.[[55]](#fn55) Schlueter also involved county law libraries in the Library’s services for the first time. Her push to have local government law libraries included in the first statewide LexisNexis and Westlaw contracts resulted in incredible cost savings at the local level. She organized and hosted the first meeting of the Texas County Law Librarians, which served to encourage cooperation and collaboration among the state’s government law libraries.

The dedication ceremony for the new State Law Library facilities took place on May 27, 1993. The ceremony’s program reflected the support system that Schlueter and her predecessors had built. Representatives from all corners of the local legal community spoke in celebration of the Library and the ideals of justice and knowledge that it represented: Supreme Court Justice Nathan Hecht, Court of Criminal Appeals Presiding Judge Michael McCormick, State Solicitor Renea Hicks, former Director Jim Hambleton, Judge John Powers of the Third Court of Appeals, and local law firm librarian Joan O’Mara.

Tony Estrada replaced Kay Schlueter as Director in 2002 and continued FOSLL and the Library’s volunteer program as an important support system for the Library. He also honored Jim Hambleton’s tradition of pursuing technology to improve the dissemination of information by initiating a historical statutes digitization project. Supported by a grant from the Litigation Section of the State Bar of Texas, the Library scanned the complete text of the 1879–1925 Revised Civil Statutes and posted them on the Library’s website to be used by the public for free.

2004–Present: The Digital Era

Dale Propp became the Director of the Library in May of 2007. The first challenge he faced was the continued disconnect between the rising costs of keeping the Library’s print collection up to date and the amount of funding provided by the Legislature. For years, the Library saw publishing costs increase steeply without a commensurate increase in budget. In the Administrator’s Statement for the Library’s FY 2008-09 Legislative Appropriations Request, Propp stated that “[i]n a comparison between the years 2000 and 2004, publishing costs have increased 38 percent.”[[56]](#fn56) Over that same time period, total funding for the Library _decreased_ by 7.5 percent.

This ever-present problem for the Library continued mounting in the 2010–11 biennium when a statewide fiscal setback caused by the 2008 recession required all state agencies to cut their budgets by 5 percent. The budget crunch reached a critical point in 2011 with the Legislature’s proposed budget for fiscal years 2012–13. The first draft of the state budget gave the State Law Library **zero** dollars in appropriated funds,[[57]](#fn57) prompting fears that the Library would be eliminated as an agency altogether. Thanks to the support of the legal community and key legislative leaders who understood the Library’s value, the Library was eventually funded but received a devastating 22 percent cut to its operating budget.[[58]](#fn58)

The only way for the Library to continue functioning on such a shoestring budget was to render deep cuts to the Library’s print collection. In 2011, the Library was forced to cancel subscriptions for many treatises and periodicals. These cuts are still felt to this day, as in the ensuing years the Library’s funding for print materials would never keep pace with rising costs, let alone increase enough to allow for the renewal of canceled subscriptions.

A common refrain during the fraught budget hearings leading up to the 82nd Legislative Session was: If Austin has so many other law libraries—why do we need the State Law Library? At first glance, Austin does have an embarrassment of riches when it comes to law libraries: , Tarlton Law Library at the University of Texas, the Legislative Reference Library, and the State Law Library. However, each library has a unique focus and serves the public in a distinct way. The other libraries serve the needs of local citizens (Travis County Law Library), the Legislature (Legislative Reference Library), and law students and legal scholars (Tarlton Law Library), and they do it exceedingly well. However, none of these libraries is mandated to serve the staff of state agencies, the practicing legal community, and the general public on a statewide basis in the way the State Law Library is.

Understanding that the library needed to distinguish itself among the other law libraries in Austin and recognizing that recent advances in technology finally made true statewide support possible, in 2013 Propp began the development of an initiative to make the Library’s resources available from a distance and expand its reach beyond the Austin city limits. Prior to this time, the Library would field calls and letters from citizens throughout the state, but the ways in which librarians could assist those remote patrons was limited. Patrons outside the Austin area certainly didn’t have the ability to use the Library’s resources to research on their own.

A complete overhaul of the Library’s website in 2013 transformed it from a simple page that only offered basic details about the Library’s services to a sophisticated site that contained usable legal information. Librarians began using software called LibGuides to create on topics that members of the public frequently asked about, such as common law marriage and small claims court. These research guides link to the text of the law itself, as well as explanatory articles which put the legal jargon of the statutes into context. At the time of their debut in January of 2013, the Library offered guides on only six topics: Common Law Marriage, Historical Texas Statutes, Historical Texas Court Rules, Name Changes, Occupational Drivers Licenses, and Small Claims Court.[[59]](#fn59) Merely a year later, there were four times as many guides, garnering _thirty-five times_ the number of monthly views. The Library currently offers sixty guides that receive approximately 70,000 total monthly visits.

In an effort to increase the amount of legal information available through the website, Propp continued and expanded Tony Estrada’s historical statute digitization initiative, eventually securing grant funding and copyright permission to digitize the Library’s historical statutes through 1984. Before the completion of this project, tracking these statutes down was difficult— only Baylor University and the State Law Library held a complete collection.

The crown jewel in the Library’s efforts to make reputable legal information widely available is the [Remote Access Program](https://www.sll.texas.gov/library-resources/collections/electronic-databases/ "Electronic Databases"), established in 2015. As legal publishers began producing e-books and online databases, Propp recognized an opportunity to use these resources to support Texans in far-flung parts of the state. The first stage of the program involved getting permission from publishers to allow the Library to make their products available remotely. Assistant Director Leslie Prather-Forbis’s careful and patient negotiations convinced numerous publishers that allowing the public to access their materials through the Library would not only not affect their profits, but it would also generate immense goodwill with the legal community.

Next, Library staff needed a way to control access to these resources and limit it to registered patrons. The Library switched public catalog systems in 2015, moving from the State Library-controlled SirsiDynix to Koha, an open-source, web-based application. Koha offered many new features that SirsiDynix lacked, including online patron self-registration. Self-registration reduced barriers to registering for a Library account, as patrons no longer had to come to the Library in person to sign up. It also offered a way for librarians to gatekeep access to the resources they planned to offer remotely.

With all the details worked out, the Library could now curate a digital collection for remote use. Prather-Forbis, who also served as Acquisitions Librarian, selected and purchased approximately five hundred e-books, ranging from self-help titles for the legal novice to specialized practice guides and treatises for attorneys. The contracts she negotiated for electronic access to legal databases were put into place. Suddenly, Library patrons had a wealth of high-quality resources available to them outside the Library’s walls. At the time of these purchases, only 59 of Texas’s 254 counties maintained any type of law library collection, not all of which were open to the public or staffed by professionals who could assist with research. Rural Texans who could not afford an attorney were often left with few ways to obtain accurate legal information. The digital resources the Library provided at no charge to all Texans, regardless of their economic status, opened up a whole new world of information.

To demonstrate the sheer scale of the volume of information available to State Law Library patrons through the Remote Access Program, one must only look at the Library’s collection of legal periodicals throughout time. In 1912, the Supreme Court Library did not receive any current periodicals.[[60]](#fn60) At the same time, the University of Texas only received four legal periodicals.[[61]](#fn61) Today, HeinOnline’s Law Journal Library includes 2,707 titles that patrons can access using their State Law Library account, at any time of day or night.

Looking to the Future

Beginning in 2013, Propp approached the Legislature each session with requests for more stable funding for the Remote Access Program. Even as usage of the program climbed steadily, indicating a real demand for the service, the Legislature declined to grant the additional funding that would sustain the program. Finally, in 2019, the Library received the good news that the Legislature had at last appropriated funds to support its efforts to provide digital legal resources.

The Library also received funding to continue the digitization project and make additional important Texas historical texts freely available via the State Law Library website. Former Library Director Marian Boner’s classic _A Reference Guide to Texas Law and Legal History,_ including links to digital editions of many of the key resources highlighted, is slated for inclusion in this project.

Today, the Library has had 14,721 users register from 223 of 254 counties in Texas, indicating considerable success in efforts to support citizens statewide. It is doubtful that visitors to the Supreme Court Library 150 years ago could ever have imagined the size and reach of the modern State Law Library’s collection. The Library is committed to continuing the traditions of excellence established by previous Supreme Court librarians and State Law Library Directors, albeit with a wider audience.

Document Delivery

The State Law Library accepts requests for legal information and copies of material in our collection. Requests are subject to . Turnaround time depends on the size of the request and librarian availability.

[Contact us with your request](/about-us/public-services/ask-a-librarian/ "Ask a Librarian").

Court Records

The library can only provide copies of certain records from the following courts:

  * the 
  * the 
  * the (criminal records only)

For help locating records from other courts, please see the library's guide. 

Copies of court records may take longer depending on the availability of the files.

The library cannot copy exhibit files from the 3rd Court of Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals. To obtain exhibits from these courts, you will need to contact the court directly. We cannot facilitate or assist you with this process. You may also contact the trial court directly.

Delivery Options

Copies can be picked up in person, mailed, or faxed upon request. Depending on the nature and size of your request, the library may also be able to send files as e-mail attachments.

Due to network restrictions, we can only send attachments that are at most 10 MB in size. Your e-mail provider may have a lower attachment size limit. You will need to verify with your e-mail provider that you can receive a file up to 10 MB in size prior to your purchase.

The library is not responsible for returned e-mails or e-mails that bounce. If you are not able to receive a file we send and would like to receive the files another way, you may incur additional charges — _e.g._ , postage, printing, a flash drive.

Certified Copies

The library can provide certified copies of Texas statutes. We certify that the copies we provide are faithful reproductions of the law as it appears in our collection.

In Texas, there is no state agency designated as the official “custodian” of the state’s compiled statutes. This means we cannot and do not certify the accuracy or authenticity of the contents of the copies. Our certification states that the copy we provide is a true and correct copy of a book in the library’s collection or of a law that was downloaded from Westlaw and printed by a librarian.

When you [contact the library](/about-us/public-services/ask-a-librarian/ "Ask a Librarian"), provide the following information:

  * The specific sections or chapters of the you are requesting;
  * If you are requesting a prior version of a law, the effective date; and
  * Mailing address, if copies are not picked up [in person](/about-us/about-the-library/ "About the Library").



About the Library's Certified Copies

Because there is no “legal custodian” of the compiled Texas statutes, people can be unsure where to turn to get a certified copy of a law.

Our copies are certified as faithful reproductions from our collection. We cannot and do not certify the accuracy or authenticity of the contents of the copies. Our certification states that the copy we provide is a true and correct copy of a book in the library’s collection or of a law that was downloaded from Westlaw and printed by a librarian. Westlaw is a product of Thomson Reuters, an unofficial publisher of the Texas statutes. Westlaw includes the electronic version of the printed statutes.

For example, we may provide certified copies from a volume of _Vernon's Texas Statutes and Codes Annotated_. We certify they were “copied from the Texas State Law Library’s copy of the publication.” The certification would not say that the wording of the original document was accurate.

The Secretary of State can provide . These bills and resolutions are not the final version of the codified statutes. They are the product of a legislative session and must be combined with the previous text of the statutes to arrive at the current text.

Likewise, there is no official publisher of the compiled Texas statutes, either electronically or in print. names official electronic publishers of the state constitution and legislative bills. It does not do the same for the compiled statutes. In 1987, the state legislature proposed a bill () which could have made _Vernon’s Texas Statutes and Codes Annotated_ the official print version of the Texas statutes. That proposal was unsuccessful, and thus there is not an official printed version of the compiled statutes. _Vernon’s_ remains an unofficial published version.

Fees

All requests are subject to:

  * Service charge of $5
  * Sales tax
  * Postage fees, if mailed
  * Requests over 500 pages incur additional $5 service charges

Reference Librarians

Reference librarians are available to help library users locate information, identify relevant resources, and develop search strategies. Our librarians are careful to avoid the unauthorized practice of law (see and ) and as such cannot give legal opinions, advice, or interpretation. We do not have attorneys on staff to advise you on how the law applies to a particular legal situation.

The library is available to:

  * Assist you in locating materials available to us relevant to your research
  * Recommend law books and websites on a particular topic
  * Provide assistance in how to use the library's resources
  * Help locate broad definitions of legal words or phrases
  * Locate areas in state and federal statutes, regulations, and rules to help you begin your research
  * Refer you to other agencies or organizations for assistance



For some of the more common legal questions, we have compiled a list of [frequently asked legal questions](/faqs/ "FAQs"). For patrons who are interested in doing their own legal research, we also make available an as well as (_e.g._ , debt collection; landlord/tenant law; divorce and child support).

For more complex questions we will conduct a reference interview to determine what type of information you require. We will then search resources available to us that we can recommend to you. Some questions are best researched by the patron at a law library. Library staff may ask you to visit the library or point you to a [law library in your area](/legal-help/find-legal-information/law-libraries-of-texas/ "County Law Libraries") as legal research is frequently complex even for what may seem like a simple yes or no question.

**Library staff cannot give legal advice. We cannot** :

  * Interpret the meaning of sources or determine their relevance to your specific situation
  * Advise you of your legal rights or recommend a course of action
  * Determine whether an action or practice is legal
  * Select specific statutes, regulations, rules, or forms for your fact situation
  * Recommend a specific attorney
  * Provide case law subject searching
  * Complete forms or handle your personal data



We provide telephone reference to patrons who call our main number . At the discretion of the librarian taking the phone call, over the phone we can:

  * Read brief portions of statutes, regulations, rules, and definitions
  * Search our catalog to see if we have a particular item in our collection
  * Guide you to pre-compiled legal information



Our staff strives to serve all library patrons. Due to the volume of reference requests, the time spent with individuals needs to be limited. When providing telephone or chat reference, we will spend approximately 5-10 minutes per interaction. For any patrons requiring further assistance, the librarian will get contact information and provide follow up information afterwards to the patron. Reference librarians are restricted in the length of time spent assisting individuals. We are unable to provide in-depth research for patrons. Please note that the library is unable to accommodate requests for assistance by a particular staff member.

Attorney General Opinions (1891–1938)

Prior to 1939, the publication of Texas Attorney General opinions was not systematic or comprehensive. These early opinions were not numbered sequentially like they are . The opinions found on this page are extracted from biennial reports from the attorney general. We provide the cover page and, whenever available, the table of contents of each biennial report along with the opinions themselves and any indexes from the report that may help you locate a particular opinion.

**Note** : The 1901–1902, 1903–1904, and 1904–1906 biennial reports do not contain any opinions, so they are not included here. We also do not have access to a report for 1910–1912. Reports prior to 1912–1914 did not have tables of contents.

The Constitution of the State of Texas: An Annotated and Comparative Analysis

In 1972, Texas voters approved a revision of the state's constitution. Prior to this revision, Professor George D. Braden and others began research in order to “provide information to aid the constitutional revision process.”

In this publication, the authors provide information regarding the origins, historical development, and contemporary meaning of each section of the . The authors also add interpretive comments. Researchers of the Texas constitution, then and now, find this publication an invaluable resource.

In the foreword, James F. Ray, director of the Texas Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, states that the principal reason for the publication was to make the information available to the public. Now the library is privileged to bring this publication to you electronically.

The library expresses its gratitude to the estate of George Braden and to the authors for allowing us to digitize and provide access to _The Constitution of the State of Texas: An Annotated and Comparative Analysis_.

This digitized version of Braden's publication was made possible thanks to a grant from the of the and with the permission of the numerous authors. Please [contact us](/about-us/public-services/ask-a-librarian/) if you run into technical issues.

Continuing Legal Education Materials

The library receives continuing legal education (CLE) materials from the State Bar of Texas. These courses allow attorneys to earn CLE credit, which is required by the Bar.

CLE materials from 2017 onward are available as e-books you can borrow with your [library account](/about-us/get-a-library-account/).

If you are interested in CLE materials only available in print but cannot visit the library in Austin, [contact us](/about-us/public-services/ask-a-librarian/) about our fee-based [document delivery](/about-us/public-services/document-delivery/) service.

Historical Texas Statutes

The library's digitization efforts have brought online over 100 years of historical Texas statutes. We provide free public access to [digitized copies of Texas statutes](#navigation) from 1879 through 1984.

About Printed Statutes

In 1854, the state legislature authorized a commission to codify existing laws. The were completed in 1856. The civil statutes followed in [1879](#1879). Subsequent revisions and recodifications followed in [1895](#1895) and [1911](#1911). In [1925](#1925), there was a reorganization of the statutes, which still serves as the basis for our current statutes.

Between the years of 1911 and 1925, there was not an “official” publication of Texas statutes even though the legislature continued to meet every other year to write and amend laws.

To fill in the gaps in the official statutes, publisher John Sayles and his son Henry Sayles compiled and published unofficial volumes of Texas statutes in 1914. Called “Vernon’s Sayles’” after the publisher, these volumes contain the text of statutes, valuable annotations, and indexes from 1911 through 1921.

After 1925, the evolution of the Texas statutes is more complicated. The statutes are not reprinted in their entirety after each legislative session. Instead, the few complete reprintings of the statutes are updated with supplemental volumes after regular legislative sessions, which occur every 2 years.

The library thanks Thomson Reuters, current copyright holders of the printed Texas statutes, for allowing us to provide access to the statutes from 1928 onward.

Legislative Recaps of the 88th Legislature (2023)

The meets regularly every 2 years (on odd-numbered years). At the end of a regular legislative session, hundreds of passed bills are sent to the governor for approval. Due to the very large number of bills and the wide variety of topics they cover, it can be difficult to get an understanding of all the new laws that were passed.

To help the public become aware of new laws, many organizations provide summaries of new legislation. Below we highlight some of the legislative summaries published by news organizations, state agencies, professional organizations, and independent writers.

Some legislative summaries may be written before the governor's veto period ends. We recommended consulting to check that a bill was not vetoed.

Restrictions After a Felony Conviction

Time in prison is often not the only consequence of a felony conviction in Texas.

This collection features [statutes](/law-legislation/texas/statutes/ "Statutes"), [regulations](/law-legislation/texas/administrative-rules/ "Administrative Rules"), and [state](/the-courts/texas-court-rules/ "Texas Court Rules") and [federal](/the-courts/federal-court-rules/ "Federal Court Rules") court rules that place restrictions on people with a felony conviction.

For a more complete listing, see the . It is a collection of laws with consequences that people with criminal records face in the United States. The information is from a study conducted by the National Institute of Justicethe U.S. Congress.

Talk to a Lawyer

State of the Judiciary Messages

Every two years, the chief justice of the prepares a state of the judiciary message. This message is usually delivered as a speech given to a joint session of the legislature. The audience at the joint session includes representatives, senators, and often also includes members of the judiciary and other dignitaries.

This message is mandated by :

> (a) At a convenient time at the commencement of each regular session of the legislature, the chief justice of the supreme court shall deliver a written or oral state of the judiciary message evaluating the accessibility of the courts to the citizens of the state and the future directions and needs of the courts of the state.
> 
> (b) It is the intent of the legislature that the state of the judiciary message promote better understanding between the legislative and judicial branches of government and promote more efficient administration of justice in Texas.

The mandating a state of the judiciary message passed in 1977 during the 65th Legislature. The law was as part of a nonsubstantive revision of statutes relating to the judiciary. It was then to specify that the message may be written or oral.

The library gives special thanks to the and the for previously digitizing some of these messages.

Scanners

The library has two scanners available for public use. There is no cost to use the scanners.

Both scanners have face-up scanning beds allowing patrons to scan a variety of materials. Once the pages have been scanned, it is possible to edit them by cropping the scan, adjusting contrast and brightness, rotating the scan, changing the resolution, and changing the scan from color to black and white.

The scanners allow patrons to save scans in a variety of formats including searchable .pdf, .jpeg, .png, rich text format, or as an audio file. These files can be saved to a flash drive, e-mailed, or uploaded to cloud services. Flash drives can be purchased at the reference desk.

Patrons are required to follow all copyright laws when using a scanner.

Law & Legislation

The structure and purpose of the federal government is set out in the constitution. The federal government enacts statutes through the Congress. Federal agencies are given rulemaking authority by Congress. The federal courts interpret the law.

Each of the 50 states has its own system of government.

In Texas, the state legislature enacts statutes. State agencies are given rulemaking authority by the legislature. Local governments like municipalities and counties may then enact ordinances within their jurisdictions. The state courts interpret the law.

Bills that become law are arranged by subject matter into various codes such as the Election Code, Family Code, and Penal Code. These statutes are published by the Texas Legislative Council. They are also available in print from private publishers.

The legislature also meets when the Texas governor calls a special session. During a special session, the states that “there shall be no legislation upon subjects other than those” set forth in the governor's proclamation or otherwise presented to the legislature by the governor.

Current Texas Statutes 

The are available online.

While there is no official publisher of the Texas statutes, _Vernon's Texas Statutes and Codes Annotated_ is the most popular and widely accepted version. _Vernon's_ includes helpful annotations to case law, prior versions of the law, and other secondary sources.

Our library has print copies of _Vernon's_ , and it is also available at many [law libraries](/legal-help/find-legal-information/law-libraries-of-texas/ "Law Libraries of Texas") across Texas.

To learn more, see from the Texas Legislative Council.

Legislative History and Intent 

Researching the history of a law or why the legislature enacted a law involves looking at different sources. Each source helps inform the intent behind the legislation.

Many sources have been digitized and are available online. For older legislation, you may need to listen to audiotape recordings of committee hearings. For very old legislation, more advanced historical research techniques may be needed.

The from the Legislative Reference Library and the guide from the Tarlton Law Library explain which sources to use and link you to digitized materials.

Bill Files

Official documents concerning a bill from the legislative process are compiled into a bill file. Bill files may contain different versions of the bill, bill analyses, financial notes, committee reports, and amendments.

Bill History

A bill's history is a list of all the legislative actions that were taken on the bill and the date each action occurred. Additional information like a committee's name may also be listed.

Case Law

Texas uses a common-law system. In a common-law system, decisions from high courts are binding on lower courts. This concept is known as setting a precedent. Case law is derived from past decisions made by the courts. Because the courts are always hearing new cases and interpreting the law, case law is constantly evolving.

Researching case law involves reading court opinions. If you are not familiar with how to read a court opinion, see our .

To locate case law, you will need to use tools like or . These sources compile and categorize case law research to help make it accessible by topic or by keyword searching. You can also use footnotes or other annotations in secondary sources like a legal encyclopedia or a [legal practice guide](/library-resources/collections/digital-collection/?category=all) to locate case law on a topic.

Municipal Ordinances

The outlines a municipality's authority to enact ordinances within its jurisdiction.

The code describes different types of municipalities like home rule and general law. Each type has specific procedures for enacting ordinances. Ordinances are usually enforced by local law enforcement agencies such as city police departments.

Counties also have some authority to enact ordinances, but a county's authority is generally more limited than that of a municipality. To access a county's ordinances, first check the county's official website. If not online, the county clerk, county judge, county commissioners, or your may provide access to county ordinances.

How to Locate Municipal Ordinances

Many municipalities publish their ordinances online, but not all do. If not online, you may need to go through the office of the city clerk or city secretary. In some small municipalities, you may need to contact the local councilpersons, mayor, aldermen, or city commissioners. Your may have a print copy of the ordinances.

The websites below are online collections for the codes and ordinances of many municipalities. If you do not find a municipality's ordinances on one site, check the others. Some municipalities may publish their ordinances on their own website rather than on a third-party site. [Ask a Librarian](/about-us/public-services/ask-a-librarian/) for assistance if you are having trouble locating ordinances.

Building Codes

Texas [statutes](/law-legislation/texas/statutes/ "Statutes"), [administrative rules](/law-legislation/texas/administrative-rules/ "Administrative Rules"), and [local ordinances](/law-legislation/municipal-laws-and-ordinances/ "Municipal Laws and Ordinances") occasionally adopt, incorporate, or refer to technical codes published by independent organizations.

These codes describe scientific and safety standards for structures and discuss specifications for construction practices, electrical systems, plumbing fixtures, fire safety, and many other topics.

Note The library cannot help determine which codes apply to your specific project.

Adopted by Reference

Even though they are incorporated as law, building codes are not reprinted within the law itself. Instead, they are “adopted by reference.” This means that the law will name the code and its publisher, but you must access the code itself elsewhere.

Where to Find Codes

We link to online editions on the publisher's website whenever possible. In addition, some local governments publish the codes and any local amendments on their website.

You may not always find the code online due to copyright restrictions from the publisher. If not online, check with your city clerk's office, a code enforcement or planning department, or a to view the code.

[ Residential Building Codes ](/law-legislation/texas/building-codes/residential-building-codes/ "Residential Building Codes")

Construction, A/C, plumbing, energy efficiency, pools and spas, and manufactured housing.

[ Non-Residential Building Codes ](/law-legislation/texas/building-codes/non-residential-building-codes/ "Non-Residential Building Codes")
